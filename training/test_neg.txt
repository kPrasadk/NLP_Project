 winder apparatus began squeak terribly couple re strings   eventually fell off no longer stay attached   
 string winder isn t made enough prevent slipping off keys winding   push real hard base mechanism prevent falling off keys  guitar   
 gets job done  plastic makes squeak much t pay attention anything else  wish had known before purchased  tried greasing pressure makes squeak   
 cheap nasty d worst part actual winding part held single screw  right where turn  turn screw along whole thing falls apart  before runs uneven  putting stress tuner assembly  find need re tighten screw every single string worth thing holding tuner bit thin  s tight fit tuners   
 worked okay   nothing special      days  cutter end broke half leaving sharp edge unusable tool  second view already posted here  cheaper buy pair wire cutters  both last much longer better   
 winder tighten strings no problem  cutter seems job however  unwind loosen strings part goes knobs comes loose comes off design screw holding piece handle together every time try loosen string screw loosens too winder always ends pieces no matter hard tighten screw always seems leaving product useless   
 were no cotton polishing cloths package  supposed were none   
 had buy another strap  not recommend anyone plays above belt  not much room adjustment   ft     like play chest high  tied knot strap high enough  better off getting     cheepo tuner   
 found irritating neck width   edges dug neck   foam rubber skin caused sweat  gave shot had return   
 friend s suggestion  purchased set hoping reduce number times had replace strings   rd string  d string  snapped during installation string wasn t close being tension while theoretically great set strings last much longer  paying     times going rate set strings breaks during installation ridiculous  contacted elixir  never heard word  much quality control customer service  not impressed suggest sticking more reliable strings  martin  ghs  etc     
 hardly lasted grandsons guitar   don t buy things  truly junk    find something else  
 put strings gretch solid body     s vintage   love full varied sound guitar  play anything   don t play much used thought try nanoweb coating super lights   hated sound   not very full  guitar has very rich sound   almost tinny never had set strings were worse    years playing   
 anyone thinking buying  don t  not waste money strings  like precisely control re playing  especially play metal   not strings  coating too slippery feel uncomfortable  importantly   tone not bright sustain horrible  t hold chord without fading quickly especially bend lot  amazing  manufactured  loud controllable strings suggest checking ghs boomers  ghs not disappointed  unlike elixir    personally ghs boomers tnt  thin top heavy bottom    
 elixir sucks  don t know got reputation  buzz  break  not last  house brand guitar strings best  fancy packaging hyped reviews  probably pay people  not worth  buy anything else

 okay  t comment sound durability cause item came metal rim were bent usually  drum heads inside cardboard box reason item came inside plastic bag wish were another swap   immediately returned got prompt credit   
 although cd used setting  yamaha midi interface windows mac  mac not read cd   had send   
 opened box remained shippment small open plastic box picks were once  seems like amazon spreading picks world since picks obviously  escaped  poorly sealed cardboard box  seems rather strange return empty pick box hey  amazon s dime     
 read reviews  figured  ordering few things shipped together  little plastic clamshell picks packed few small items  capo  strings  wouldn t stuck huge box   picks were packed appropriately small box items  like many reviews opened picks came  able   box  seven disappeared   don t order picks  ll frustrated   wish d heeded warnings read here   
 received purchase todsy were   picks instead advertised      seems recurring problem item   not suggest ordering item   very disapointing  
 gives nine picks came bottom box bulky boxes heavier items  picks  little soft  plastic container wide open without picks  nine picks were bottom box  m wondering why were shipped same box bulky items little soft plastic case  should been cushioned envelope placed box shipment mailed separately cushioned envelope  amazon thinking add insult injury were nine picks bottom box  m not sure fender t count soft plastic case had sprung open prior amazon packing never made trip  either  whole thing drecky height dreck tude   shame both fender amazon m ticked haven t pulled guitar try picks  ll include calm down speak amazon customer service     
 shocked open box  ordered amazon    empty containers  couple loose picks box  ordered      thought feedback must been fluke s true  requested replacement received email amazon stating issue refund instead replacement item  stock   s not  much turning amazon gift buying   update  had re order   key order item items big enough limit movement pick package box   less pick loss   
 regret inform those terrible service company website offers  made order month ago   still no package  used patience future taking business elsewhere   
 packaging big problem here  plastic shell picks opens during transit picks scatter  pointed reviews  got seven dozen ordered  puts upper tier success product vendor  beare probabilities not getting money s worth     
 contrary reviews s plenty loud  like wood block sound  however  failed notice before purchase skips numbers  slowest speed  largo  allows chose times     example  goes           etc   larghetto goes three             andante begins increase tempo   beats per minute             allegro presto beats per minute                  thus  wanted play song     bpm     not able metronome  might players not  very bummed bought replace digital metronome lost  wish remembered brand name very nice  allowed set tempo speed wanted  including odd tempos like           
 sure retailer did not mean ship defective capo  seem responsive correcting problem  hope     credited per e mail   
 capo has tightened very frequently during playtime  really does not make practicing ideal tool delivery time spot
