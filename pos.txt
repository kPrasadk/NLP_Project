this was written for Carin Levine in 2008, but not premiered until 2011 at the Musica Viva Fest in Munich. .the work's premise maybe about the arduousness, nefarious of existence, how we all "Work" at life, at complexity, at densities of differing lifeworlds. Ferneyhough's music might suggest that these multiple dimensions of an ontology exist in diagonals across differing spectrums of human cognition, how we come to think about an object,aisthetic shaped ones, and expressionistic ones as his music.The work has a nice classical shape,and holds the "romantic" at bay; a mere 7 plus minutes for Alto Flute, a neglected wind cadre member.The work has gorgeous arresting moments with a great bounty of extended timbres-pointillistic bursts" Klangfarben Sehr Kraeftig" that you do grow weary of; it is almost predictable now hearing these works; you know they will inhabit a dense timbral space of mega-speed lines tossed in all registers;still one listens; that gap Freud speaks about, that we know we need this at some level. . .the music slowed at times for structural rigour.. .  we have a dramatic causality at play in the subject,(the work's title) the arduousness of pushing, aspiring, working toward something; pleasurable illuminating or not, How about emancipation from itself;I guess we need forget the production of surplus value herein,even with the rebellions in current urban areas today; It has no place. . .  these constructions  are leftovers from modernity, the "gods" still hover. . ."gods" that Ferneyhough has no power to dispel. . . . All are now commonplace for the new music literature of music.This music still sound quite stunning, marvelous and evocative today,it is simple at some level, direct, unencumbered and violent with spit-tongues,gratuitous lines, fluttertongue,percussive slap-keys,tremoli wistful glissandi harmonics, fast filigreed lines, and simply threadbare melos, an austere fragment of what was a melody. . .Claudio Arrau said someplace that the performer the musician must emanate a "work" while playing music, a "struggle", aesthetic or otherwise, Sviatoslav Richter thought this grotesque, to look at a musician playing the great music. It was ugly for him. . .You can hear Ms.Levine on youtube playing her work, she is quite convincing, you always need to impart an authority,succored in an emotive focus that the music itself has not succumbed to your own possession. You play the music, it doesn't "play" you. . . I'd hope though that music with this arduous construction and structural vigour that it would in fact come to possess the performer. . .it is one of the last libidinal pleasures remaining. . .
I'm too busy using it to take time out to review it. I suggest that you get it, I did.
This is a two CD set each CD is 30 minutes long.  The second CD is for the "music discovery book", I love this CD, it is just perfect for group music classes and it is a fun CD for kids to just listen to.  There are 25 songs: a hello song (mentions mozart mouse and beethoven bear), a goodbye song (could be used for any program), 8 rhythm instrument songs, 5 movement/music appreciation songs, and 8 listening/ear training songs.The first CD is essentially a "book on CD" of the "music lesson" book and I don't see why you would ever use it because a teacher could read the story herself much more entertainingly.
This CD is absolutely awesome. My daughter loves listening to the stories of Clara Schuman Cat, Beethoven Bear and Mozart Mouse. There are stories to listen to as well as wonderful renditions of the songs in the book. They have two differently played songs which helped my daughter a lot. It would be nice to have one of the renditions have the songs sung. Having to learn 10 songs for her recital with every song using the same 5 notes made it difficult for her to remember them all as they sounded so similar.
We absolutely love this line of books. My 4 year old is now on the third set and playing away! It's made her lessons fun and easy. And I love that she can play with the cd's accompaniment.
There'd be a lot more amazing guitarists in the world.  Intense Rock I is mainly directed at improving technique providing a lot of different 3-note-per-string, string skipping and sweep arpeggios sequences.  Paul does a great job at breaking these things down while giving us a taste of his goofy sense of humor, but for my money Intense Rock II is king.  Among other things Paul covers dynamics and control, and the last segment on practicing alone is worth the money.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up, your guitar will thank you.
Paul's ability to teach is amazing.  VERY relevant and ALWAYS fun!  For 20 years now he has been and continues to keep things easily understood that are essential in taking your technique to a new level.  As a player whom has been playing for 30 years now myself, Paul's breakdown of left and right-hand technique finally got me over the "hump" I had not been able to overcome most of my guitar playing days as I finally overcame a plateau and quickly saw noticable improvment in speed and accuracy as I finally got the metronome setting to click higher than ever and still growing.
I actually bought this video (vol 1) when I was 11 or 12 when it first came out with my allowance that I saved up. As a guitar teacher and someone with 20 plus years playing experience, I can say that this is the best video on shred guitar technique. Volume 1 alone is well worth the price. My only issue(a VERY minor one) is that he doesn't talk about the metronome and its usage. But any good teacher can explane that in about 2 minutes.Volume 2 while not quite as shred heavy is still a great dvd to have(and just as important content). It concetrates more on phrasing, dynamics, rythmic ways of building phrases, etc. Don't worry, there is still plenty of shredding as well.These volumes are the best investments I ever made as a guitar player,teacher and student. Anyone who wants to learn how to shred, get this dvd package, and a book on music theory(or instruction by a teacher) and a good chord book and you'll have everything you ever need.Keep in mind, no matter what, you still have to practice(alot!!!!). No book, Dvd, or anything is going to MAKE you play well. If you are a beginner(or even advanced), you still have to work hard. However, this is a big help.
Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together.  His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping.  I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument.  Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion, and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works.  I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years, and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three.  If you are at all interested in shred guitar, you simply have to buy this.  Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II), so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price.  Thanks, Paul!
If your leads only consist of Box 1 of the minor pentatonic scale, this DVD will leave you in the dust quickly. This is only for guitar hero-shredder types that have real chops. You need to be fluent in music theory, you must have absolute command of the entire fretboard, and you need to be fast in all the scale modes to keep up with the material. The video is very entertaining and packed with info that will help any guitarist no matter your skill set; the problem is, you won't be able to play the examples up to speed. Watching a virtuoso like Mr Gilbert run up and down the fretboard at the speed of light is worth the price of the DVD. An amazing guitarist!
Paul is the master of fast guitar licks. I mean Wow!!he teaching very valuable technique that is helping me improve my speed. I've got all the DVDs and bought them for my kids too! Thanks Paul!!!Tommy G
This video guitar lesson is for those who want to get a bit more technical into their repertoire. Intense Rock 1 has old school Paul (good old Racer X days) teaching us the basics of soloing, scaling and just good guitar playing overall. I like how he also incorporates funny skits in between sessions which is great cos learning guitar is meant to be a fun experience too (in his case anyways). Intense Rock 2 kinda builds on the first, introducing a few more patterns and sequences. Paul continues his humorous presentation keeping the audience awake and laughing. I play with a whammy bar so it's a bit of a shame PG doesn't like it too much but that's his playing style I guess.Overall PG is a cool and fun down-too-Earth guitar teacher you won't be disappointed. Oh and did I mention he's the world's 4th fastest guitar player?
I've worn out this video over the years cause I got it on VHS,now its on DVD! My few comments on Paul Gilbert is that through his playing,he show's alot of discipline and passion on the way he play's. but most of all, he's passionate about music thats why he got to the level of where he's at. I've meet him couple of times at a NAMM show and it was like talking to the next door neighbor. no rocks star attitude just plain Paul Gilbert DOWN TO EARTH...If your like me who's alway's practicing to get better all the time and to learn more, GET THIS DVD and apply the skills you learn from Paul in a band situation when its called for. I happen to be fortunate that growin up in the 80's doing this stuff called shred playing was the NORM back then, so I caught up to this GIT style real quick and for the most part,this was the ticket to be in a band back then.if you've never done this kinda stuff then be prepared for some seriouse learning curve adjustments. Dont give up keep up on practicing and discipline,some things dont come easy but when you get there, its personaly an awesome accomplishment,convidence builder. but most of all one's you can master 2 or 3 of Paul's licks it comes easier cause it builds on top of each other. happy picking and have some good laughter on Paul's humor...
For music, Jerry Lee can't be beat and his piano touch is excellent and no one can take care of a amelody like him. He is Beethoven in the type of music he does. If you like music he can't be beat. If to you music is noise, look for a guitar player.Carl
This is a compilation of his two vhs tapes.  The Jazz Fusion Improvisation section covers all the scales, arpeggios, triads, outside playing, etc, you could ask for.Melodic Phrasing is a real gem.  Scott does an amazing job at teaching phrasing.  This DVD is about improvisation and making musical statements not just learning the top 50 guitar licks.  In my ears Scott is the best improvising guitarist on the scene today.
i was a bit suprised to find that there wasnt much info on actually screaming on the dvd, until i figured out that all the breath control and positioning of the voice IS how you scream, overall this is the best vocal instructional dvd i have come accross. and the cd that comes with it for the warmup is invaluable!!buy this dvd!
Easy to follow and understand. Melissa Cross made an amazing product with instant results. All-around better vocals, stamina, range, breathing. Everything you could expect and more, a must have for every hardcore/metal vocalist!
I'm a vocal teacher, and I thought it had some good insight into the sort of vocals that I haven't had any training in. It also covers some basics that every singer should know.
The only downside is that the production seems to have been executed by someone who normally does infomercials. Echoing other reviews, some of it comes off as an ad. That said...My voice would most likely be in much better shape if this had been available 10 years ago.  On one hand, the natural gravel that comes with completely destroying your vocal cords does sound kind of cool at times.  On the other, it would be nice to have the choice to turn it off.If you are a metal singer and you pay attention to this DVD, it will be one of those events that may not garner the significance it deserves but none the less will positively affect the musical aspect of the rest of your life.Although much damage has already been done in my case, and I'd already learned many of the lessons from experience, TZOS did introduce me to some new exercises and very practical techniques that have had an immediate impact on my performance.Any metal singer would be foolish not to check it out.
Had this video when it came out on VHS and had to get it again for DVD... great, useful education from the master.
As an experience screamer, this DVD saved my vocal chords from dying after not screaming for 2 years. The technique she's using with low volume is amazing, I could be screaming for hours without anything happening to my chords.I wish I could meet her personally and thank her.
The video starts out with Mike Inez talking about his career and when he joined Ozzy, which is an awesome story and could be a DVD all on its own.  The lessons are Mike showing you how to play 2 Alice in Chain songs of which he also gets a drummer and plays the song at the end of each lesson, very cool. I got the DVD because I wanted to be able to see his technique and hear his sound. This video did not disappoint. The sound and quality is very good, and it was well worth what I paid for.
Don Mock. What else is there to say. Add it to your library with all his other great publications. This is the other half of the puzzle.
This DVD is Great!  If you are interested in playing Jazz this is it! In his DVD John Riley presents exercises to improve skills and timing and gives ideas how to combine all these to up the level of your drumming. The DVD also has play along tracks and a printable pdf to the various exercises so you can chop it out at your own pace. Very helpful for me as a beginner.  Make no mistake this DVD has challenges and benefits for all skill levels. I will be able to watch it a thousand times and pick up something new each time as I progress. My favorite section is the creativity part where the author breaks down some signature patterns of the greats like Max Roach, Art Blakey, and Elvin Jones allowing you to learn and incorporate these "tributes" in your own personal style.. I really appreciate these little stylistic breakdowns! Great! Great! Great!  Mr. Riley shares his love for the drums and inspires with his knowledge and interest in the art.  Overall a great tool for me to become a better drummer and keep challenging myself!Blickum Blickum Brrrappata splash
Just thought this DVD deserved another 5 star review.The other reviews cover the material presented on the DVD nicely.The PDF printouts included are basically a 17 page "book" of in depth material (also presented on the DVD) that really compliments and supports the excellent instruction books that John Riley has already written.  I would have happily dished out $15-20 (or alot more!) just for those gems.Well worth the money- one of the more in-depth, concept building music instruction DVD's I've seen.  You really feel like you are sitting in on a lesson and getting valuable insights about practical steps you can take to make music more functional and.....musical.Thank you Mr. John Riley
I am an intermediate/advanced drummer with a rock and blues background.  I was stuck in a rut playing the same things over and over and wanted to explore the world of jazz drumming.  This dvd has given me about a years worth of new material.  The instruction is amazing.  The disc comes with play along tracks and tabs for a lot of the exercises.  The disc shows groves, fills, literally everything.  I love it.
John Riley does an amazing job with his DVD "The Master Drummer".  His explanations alone are worth it's weight in gold, but he shows how to play all the material with great camera angles.  John goes through the 4 qualities which make a great player:  Technique, Groove, Creativity, and Musicianship.  I bought this about 2 years ago and still go through the exercises, as this stuff will keep you busy for a long time.  If you find some of the technique lessons too tough at first (especially the comping), I would recommend starting with John's book "Art of Bop Drumming", and easing into this DVD.  Today my studies include John's books Beyond Bop Drumming and Jazz Drummers workshop, and this DVD.  My favorite section is the creativity section which really enhanced my soloing chops, he talks about the jazz dialect and how to get your own sound, so after learning the exercises, you will find yourself creating your own fills (sometimes without thinking about it).  That is the mark of a great teacher, and John is clearly one of the best.
The creator of the this DVD Jimmy Brown, has a great way of teaching, I bought this and the compainion Volume, due to his work on the Led Zepplin book and DVD, he does a great job of making difficult things simple.  You can print out the text that goes with this DVD and there's plenty of information to keep you busy
Fantastic video, for beginning metal guitarists. Dimebag's got everything he needed as a guitar player. I wished was his student. But you can learn a lot of his technique by watching this video, and this video rocks, thanks to Nick Bowcott for making it happen!
I got this because I really like Billy Martin's playing.  It is not really an instructional video in the traditional sense. I think of it more as an opportunity to hang out with a really great musician and listen to him play and talk about playing.  As such, it was fascinating.  I didn't know that much about Billy before seeing this and it was nice to hear him talk about taking lessons, some early gigs, and how he developed his approach to the instrument.  His co-host is his first teacher, whom I had never heard of before, but who also had many interesting things to say about music and drumming.
For real, honest, really inspirational with excellent playing, and telling. Strongly recommended to all with an ear for music, regardless of style.
I bought it for my 6 years old son. He is loving it. His teacher too approved it. It comes with a book and two CDs. I got it for $50 couple of weeks ago (around first week of Nov 2012) and now I see the price is higher. Lucky me.
I bought this for my 9 year old daughter to learn on. The guitar instructor praised the craftsmanship for a starter guitar, solid build with no shoddy workmanship. The instructional materials have really helped bridge the gap between self-study and formal lessons, they keep my daughter in practice between lessons. The tuner is super helpful for a beginner to help keep the instrument in tune, which for the first month or so is essential as the strings loosen. I highly recommend this for any parent with a guitar interested child.
Our 8 year old daughter is having a blast learning to play the guitar. Such easy instructions for her to follow. Great for just starting out.
Great deal and awesome product for kids. My son loves it and it fits his body well. Wish it came with a stand, but you can't have it all!
I examined the item and the Guitar plays good for a starter and the quality was above what i expected.I will definitely recommend it to anyone. I know my child will love it
My 10 year old daughter just took up guitar lessons.  We have no musical experience, so we really had no idea what she needed, but did our best with info we got from her instructor.  Turns out, this was perfect.  Fits her great, tunes well, and the instruction book was the one her instructor wanted to work out of.  And for the price: $50.00, we couldn't go wrong!
This is a beautiful guitar. I mean really nice. Switch the cheap strings out for nice ones and you've got yourself a great little guitar. You will be amazed at the beauty of this guitar, trust me. The electronic tuner is really difficult to understand, maybe it's me. The included CD however makes it very easy to tune the guitar. Nice course included also, good for beginners. This is a great package, unbelievable quality for this price.
I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly i received my order. It was in excellent condition. I'm a totally satisfied customer. I wouldn't hesitate to order from them in the future!
This DVD is probably not a training video...but it is still incredible to watch and listen to Carter.  He is undoubtedly one of the most talented and musical drummers in the world.  Anyone who appreciates true musicianship would benefit from this video.
This is a fantastic video of an unreal drummer.  Carter is so good, and that is so obvious when you watch this video.  As a beginner, it's overwhelming, but also inspiring.  If you're a Dave Matthews Band fan, and a drummer, this is a must have video.
This one of tge greatest classics there are.  If you need a pick up or a good cheer, this is a great one to do it. Full of love, hope and determination.
Ive always enjoyed the movie. I was tickled pink to get it on my kindle. Now I can watch it anywhere in piece and quiet (kids) with my earbuds.
To start out, this is one of my favorite books. So I of course started out with an additude to begin with, muttering that the book was always better. In this case, I was so wrong. The characters portrayed in this film are the same ones I met in 5th grade when I first read "Little Women". The actors shine in their roles and truly embody everyone one of the literary creations they represents.Playing the March matriarch, Susan Sarandon is great! She is able to maintain the feel of the period while bringing to Marmee an empowering bout of women's rights thoughts. Sarandon gives off warmth and knowledge wiht the apparent ease of someone completely familiar with the material.Wynona Ryder is another standout here. She is the raging bundle of emotion that we have all come to know as Jo March. Playing down her usually unique features, Ryder plays the part with spunk and earnestness.My favorite here is Christian Bale as the oft put uopn Theodore "Laurie" Lawrence. Quite a jump from his "Newsies" days, Bale is the best Laurie I have seen on screen to date. He has the mannerisms and lines down to perfection, while still maintaining the spontanaity that really is a huge part of Laurie's character. He also handles the age jump incredibly well.Not until my most recent viewing of the movie did I realize Gabriel Byrne was Professor Bhaer. The native irishman does a great job of bringing Frerdrick to life, right down to his physical bumbling and poetic heart.In my opinion, this movie was a complete triumph and a complete success from novel to film. All actors are fine in their roles, most exceptional, and it is such a joy to see an old favorite and all-time classic brought to life which such enthusiasm and talent. This is a must-see for any fan of the novel~although it will leave you yearning for "Little Men" and Jo's Boys" featuring this cast-which has yet to be done!!
I have loved this movie since I was young and I'm so excited to now have it on DVD and watch it anytime!
My family of boys and girls loves this family classic.  We can sit and watch it anytime and remember that the most important things are under your own roof.
Another of my favorite movies and just had to add this one to my collection! I know that you will love it, too!
LOVED this one! Even though I always imagined Jo not as pretty as she is in this movie, this was an excellent movie!
One of my very favorites! Heartwarming story, well acted and one I love to watch over and over. Great around the holidays...or really anytime!
My mother loves Little Women and has only had it on VHS until now. I decided I better buy her a DVD copy since our old VCR is bound to break down soon. My mother and sister always have loved this movie and book together.
"Rich" is the word I would best use to describe this movie. It's rich in cinematography with gorgeous scenery and interiors; rich in characters with all good-hearted men and women of character; rich in love for each whether its for family or for suitors and rich in storytelling.Yes, it's definitely more of a woman's movie than a man's, and not the sort of thing I would normally enjoy, but this movie was so well-done that I cannot say anything negative about it. In the modern-era of film-making (late '60s to today), it is always a pleasure to see a totally clean and nice movie.The cast is excellent. It's nice to see Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon play "wholesome" roles, something they don't always do, but they do it well here. Ryder is the star of this story although everyone gets decent screen time.If this film appears slow in the first 20-30 minutes, hang in there because it gets better and better as it goes along. This is just a beautiful film with fantastic visuals and memorable story that should bring a tear or two to your eyes by the end. Great storytelling usually wins out, and that's the case with this movie.
This is one of those movies where if it's on, I have to watch it. I love the feel of this movie and around the holidays, I just love how it makes me feel. I am a sucker for a period piece and this one is flawless. None of the acting or clothes seem out of place for the era. The majority of actors just can't pull it off and end up over acting. Everyone in this cast did an excellent job. I checked out the old version with Katherine Hepburn and I cringed all the way through it at her horrid idea of what &#34;quirky&#34; might have meant. She looked like a pure idiot and I was embarrassed FOR her.  Winona Ryder was as natural as they come and never once mistook quirky for imbecile. lol
This movie is great to watch at Christmas time. I think it is not as detailed as the book, but definately as good. Though in the book, Louisa May Alcott focuses on all the girls, but in the movie they focus on Joe, it is a bit of a tear jerker, but still farely jolly. It's wonderful to curl up on the couch on a snowy or rainy day with a soft blanket and like one piece of kleenex. I recommend this movie to pretty much anyone.
i ordered this to watch with my granddaughter. i really like this movie. it was just what we expected. I would order again. thank you
I SELL MADAME ALEXANDER DOLLS LITTLE WOMEN GROUPS AND I ALWAYS SELL THE BOOK WITH THE 6 LITTLE DOLLS USUALLY FOR CHRISTMAS.
I have read the book Little Women as a little girl of about seven and I fell in love with it.  Imagine how I feel about a well written and wonderfully acted movie Bravo and Brava to everyone!!!!
Good product and rec'd. within the promised time.  I love the movie and am replacing my VHS version with this one.
I must confess: I never read the book; I never saw the theatrical release; I never even watched this movie when it was first shown on TV. Somehow, by the rarest of conincidences, I caught it again in its unedited entirety on television last Christmas. Late at night, watching this movie alone after everyone's gone to sleep, with the spirit of the holidays still fresh in my body, I was entranced. I couldn't turn myself away. This was no movie; it was a revelation to me.This must sound silly to most people, for someone to relate a movie watching experience akin to religious awakening. To understand my initial response to this film would take scholars in psychology and sociology. Suffice it to say that I being an only-child has no siblings, and watching this movie makes me feel like I'm part of a real family every time, only if it's just for a couple of hours.Being a long-time resident of the area (Vancouver) where this movie was made couples me even closer to it emotionally. Every time that Thomas Newman score starts, every time the camera pans across the spring flowers, fall leaves and winter snow, every time any one of the &quot;sisters&quot; flashes a smile on screen, I feel like time and space stopped just a little, for me.I have since that initial viewing purchased the DVD. I watch it whenever my life gets too noisy. Go out and buy it if you haven't already. After that, whine to your mom for a sister or brother. I sure wish I did. :)
i have watched this movie several times but never get tried of it.i love everything about i think every house hold should owen at least one copie.thanks
I have seen all of versions of Little Women.  However, with the music and the scene where Beth dies and Joe is remembering is the most touching scene in movie history.  The acting is up to date and not mushy like the others.  Most of all Beth dying made me cry up to about the seveth time.  I guess I`m all cried out.A great versiion.
This is a great movie to watch any time of year, but especially around the holidays.  The all-star cast, including Wynona Ryder, Claire Danes, Susan Sarandon, Christian Bale, and Kirsten Dunst give amazing performances that feel like you're watching a real life drama play out.  Just be careful, make sure the kleenex are nearby.  A must-have!
This is a great book for anyone to keep in their library.  I've read it twice and watched the movie many times.
The movie is great! It came on time and and it works just fine. There is really noting else to say!
This movie, the story line as well as the scenery and music, is like balm to my busy frazzled soul. Also, it just wouldn't be Christmas until I watch it with my daughters. I love this version!
This is a truly wonderful movie. It is a beautiful adaptation of a beloved book. The film strays from the book a little, mostly by rearranging the order in which things occur. It also gives Marmee (Sarandon) a feminist twist, which is fine by me, but may bother some purists. I was also dissapointed that they pratically obliterated the character of Mr. Laurence. Ryder does a great job as Jo, capturing her firey spirit. Gabriel Byrne was absolutely perfect as Professor Bhaer! This is one of my favorite roles to watch him in and his final scene with Jo is so touching and beautiful, it just makes my day! The rest of the cast was wonderful, with the exception of Samantha Mathis. Her portrayal of the older Amy was so stilted and cold, I couldn't understand for the life of me where the younger Amy went and why in the WORLD Laurie chose her. Little Women is a beautiful film with a gorgeous score that keeps you suspended in its world. This is a great movie that everyone can enjoy during the holidays, or whenever.
We loved the book and can't stop watching the movie!  My daughter is 5 - year - old and it is one of her favorites!
Louisa May Alcott's Classic novel of sisterly love is brought to life in a truly remarkable motion picture production.Little Women is a vibrant,lavish version of this timeless classic.The costumes,sets and acting are very well done indeed.I feel the films strongest point however is Winona Ryder's engaging portrayal of the storys main character &quot;Jo&quot;.It's although Louisa May Alcott had her in mind to play this part when she wrote the story over a hundred years ago.The story of a young woman irevocably engaged in her talent and passion for storytelling and the loved ones around her.An acting triumph for Wynona Ryder!A great family film and also a film to enjoy with whoever you happen to be watching with.A truly inspiring Tale,I loved it!
The transaction was seamless from ordering to delivery. The product arrived in good condition and well ahead of my expected timeline.Thanks
This is my favorite movie to watch when I am feeling ill or the weather outside is a little too cold to bear. Winona Ryder's portrayal of Jo March is stunningly perfect. A great movie to snuggle up on the couch and watch.
Among many other things, the music is what makes this movie fantastic.  It is by far the best version of Little Women I've seen simply because of the music.  And Winona Ryder makes the perfect Jo.
She loves it, great movie, wonderful for young girls.  I wish there were more movies like this.  Easy for her to download onto her kindle
Love! Love! Love this adaptation of Little Women!
I first fell in love with the book as a child and thought this movie was a wonderful adaptation of Alcott's writing.  Definitely a feel-good, nostalgic movie.
This was the perfect Christmas gift for my daughter in law.  It is a classic as well as a wonderful collector's series.
I got it for my 11 y.o. girls since she just finished the book. We both enjoyed it so much!
I watched this delightful period movie on tv and when it was over , I wanted to buy the DVD. I thought about amazon  and found just what I was looking for at avery good price. It took about 10 days or so and I recieved it in the mail in good condition. I'm very happy and I will do bussiness again.
I wanted to order this movie as a little Christmas gift for myself, and I am amazingly disappointed that it is currently not available! There's nothing better on a winter's night--or any night, for that  matter--than a  mug of hot chocolate, a warm pair of slippers, and Little Women in the VCR.  I have gotten all of my roommates hooked! We rent it on a regular basis  whenever we have spare time between final exams or term papers. Winona  Ryder was deserving of the Oscar nomination she received for her portrayal  of Jo! As a matter of fact, all of the actors were outstanding! Having read  the book numerous times since I was a child, I find myself even  more  captivated by the movie! (How often is that possible! )  The score is pure  magic. The colors are rich. The details are superb. While I'm usually not  one for movies that end up with everyone living happily ever after in an  all-too-convenient way, Little Women makes me feel content with its loving  ending, rather than cynical. An especially good film for children.
This version of Alcott's classic story is luminescent, brilliantly acted, perfectly staged, and far more emotional than the book.Katharine Hepburn's Jo, six decades earlier, was hard to top, but Winona Ryder does it -- with sensitivity, more believable passion, and a far more expressive face. Ryder's Jo is entirely believable in her plunging into writing with reckless abandon, more so than Hepburn, for whom it took second place to love. Yet, paradoxically, the romance is far more believable for the newer Jo when it does come along.Everyone else in the story reflects her struggles and triumphs, and it's a stellar ensemble cast. Especially adept are Trini Alvarado, a conflicted and beautiful Meg; Claire Danes, trembling and heartbreaking as Beth; Christian Bale, giving a raucous edge to next-door Laurie; and most of all, Gabriel Byrne, a younger-by-15-years Prof. Bhaer, finally made both believable and romantic.All actors portray the same character throughout except for Kirsten Dunst and Samantha Mathis, who assay Amy at ages 12 and 17. Others have criticized this casting, but it worked well for me, especially in the older Amy taking her propriety and &quot;finishing&quot; far more seriously than it deserved.The story does depart slightly from the book, but not from Alcott, and the film is better for it -- certainly less precious and affected. A few plot elements from &quot;Little Men&quot; and later books flesh out this story, and Alcott's own attitudes about empowering women are brought into Susan Sarandon's quietly powerful Marmee. The Alcott family's intellectual interests inform Jo's stay in New York, adding some depth and grounding to her character and romantic feelings.This new DVD's features are a delight, especially in Gillian Armstrong's intense narration on the commentary track. She had a vision and depth of attention to this film's details that ought to be celebrated, yet rarely is for women directors. Outtakes are also narrated, a rarity. The making-of featurette and other elements are well-shaped, though Danes's behind-the-scenes program from HBO is not present, which is a bit disappointing.The transfers are crisp and clear, both video and audio. Thomas Newman's brilliant music can be heard on a separate audio track, and anyone who likes this film should watch it once with just his evocative (and often-imitated) score filling the ears.
This is a great movie (from a great book)! My daughter loves to watch it and talk about the characters. It's so nice to see a movie of quality.
***WARNING: I HAVE INCLUDED A SPOILER BELOW***This is one of the sweetest movies I have ever seen. I am a guy and I loved it. I have to admit that Claire Danes' (Beth) death scene is probably the saddest scene I  have ever seen in a movie. Very good performances by Winona Ryder and  Danes. Recommended.
This is the best version of Little Women ever made into film.  The cast makes you believe they really are the March family and the film is a joy to watch from begining to end and is a must have.
At first glance, I thought it would be made indecently due to the price, and the simplicity of the design. But boy, was I wrong. For the price you pay, this flute can really put out some good tunes. The instrument in general is easily to learn, but hard to master. I'm not about to say you should consider joining an orchestra with this thing, but for around the house, and casual playing for friends and family use, it's a wonderful buy! I'd definitely recommend this product for anyone looking into beginning to play the tinwhistle.
The pieces are beautiful.  It's even better if you have several violinists playing the alto and  bass parts (harmony A and B)
There aren't a lot of didgeridoo instructional materials out there - unless you happen to be fortunate enough to go to a didg festival.  This is a better buy than most of them because it includes 5 cds.  You could feasibly practice along with the instructors and be quite good by the 5th cd.  If you open up the liner notes, there are some written hints and a few photos, also.
These etudes are a lot of fun to play.  They're really nice jazz solos, with great melody lines and more than a little swing.  The same part can be played on either alto or tenor, as two different backing track CDs are provided-- the backing band transposes so you don't have to.  As an amateur player (recreational clarinetist in high school/college years, years ago) and relative sax newbie, I find them challenging.  But the tempos are moderate, and they are accessible to anyone who is comfortable with basic sax technique and jazz rhythms, and help develop tone and improve fluidity in the fingering.
The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.
This pop filter is great. It looks and performs like a studio filter. If you're recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing.
Even better value than building one yourself. Works very effectively, especially on large diaphragm condenser microphones. Clamp can be attached to mic stand without damaging the stand.
This mounted quickly and easily to my mic stand and is working well. There is a noticeable change in the sound quality which is very nice. The flex arm holds its position which is nice. I was expecting it to be kind of flimsy, but I've been using it, moving it off and on my desk for 2 months now and it's still going strong.
great pop filter best i seen yet!!and i use to have a big one that i dont know why i payed 50 dollars for its weird.
Brokeback Mountain has to be one of the best made and thoughtout films of its time. For this decade, i believe this film should on that list for best film made. it was timeless & classic. the movie did something movies lack these days and that is to make a statement that has direct correlation with present day times. brokeback mountain is an eye opener film to show the public that love is love and that the homophobic sentiments we flame our society ruins love. jake & heath did a great job acting wise and making every secene realistic. i do believe that they should had won best picture and also nominating "a love that will never grow old" for best song should have also been instead of giving the award to a rap duo. the only problem i had with the movie is their choice for ennis' wife. i do believe that the role could have been played by someone else rather than michelle williams. it is understandable since there are some sexual scenes between heath & michelle and they after all married. anne hathaway's character was sort of trivial. the film really was all about jake & ennis and i can not wait for this to pop out on dvd. i will be buying this dvd the first hour it is released and probboly pre ordered.brokeback mountain.... you deserve best picture from every award show this year... whether it is the oscars or the sags or even mtv movie awards! you deserve it all!
There is absolutely nothing left to say about this film that hasn't already been said.  Yet I feel compelled to add my five cents, if only because of the slight it received at the Academy Awards.  Simply put, this is the most important American film of the past twenty-five years.  It is provocative, it is breathtakingly beautiful, and it is flawlessly acted, but it is also a movie with a heart, and I defy anyone with the sensitivity of a snail not to be moved by Jack and Ennis' tragic love story.  The movie has received its share of criticism, but bear in mind that most of that has come from people who refuse to see the film.  I'm including Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine, among other Academy voters, who allowed their bigotry to stand in the way of their seeing the film.  They cast their votes in ignorance.  Go figure.  But none of that has stopped "Brokeback" from becoming possibly the most honored film in the history of cinema.  It has won fourteen Best Picture awards that I know of, beginning with the Vienna Film Festival Award and including the recent GLAAD Award for best picture.  It is a film that will continue to be viewed and studied, both for pleasure and for pure love of cinema for decades to come.  I place "Brokeback" in the same category as "Romeo and Juliet" or "La Traviata"--one of the great love stories of all time.  As Emmy Lou Harris sings on the sound track, "A Love that Will Never Grow Old."  Hats off to Ang Lee, to Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossawa, and to Heath and Jake, but a special bow to Annie Proulx, whose short story started it all, when it originally appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 1997.  The short story and the film are indisputable masterpieces.
It's out, it's about and it's still a moving love story.Unless you broke your back and have been incommunicado or living off in the vast wilderness on some mountain, you've heard much - perhaps too much - about this film. But Ang Lee's groundbreaking film, as much about the restraints of role-playing and societal expectations as the angst and amore between two itinerant male ranchers, deserves, deserves repeated looks. Seeing the film on a small(er) screen works for and against the movie; the haunting sadness that permeates the tale is a tangible, claustrophobic ache; the awesome expanse of the outback is reduced to screen-saver souvenirs. The acting is subtle and superb; we are consistently drawn to the subtly nuanced performance of Michelle Williams. She may have lost the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, but her work remains powerfully passionate and potent, an essential reminder that love - all love - that will never grow old.
This movie kept you going from start to finish. You were left feeling the sorrow and the seperation felt by the two main characters. Someone made a comment to me about how far we have come since the 1960's when this story took place. I made quick to say that had we really? Look at Matthew Shepard. This movie shows you that despite what the world thinks is right or wrong, it's about loving someone. That love can survive alot of things. I think that anyone who sees it will not be disappointed and that each person will get something different out of the story. It is very deservant of the attention and nominations it is receiving. Hats off to the two actors in their portral of such a touching story.
Brokeback Mountain has certainly given rise to a wave of homophobic jokes, reflecting a national nervousness about the subject, especially when applied to that most archetypically male American activity, cowboy life.  Ironically, there should be no surprise whatever that male-dominated societal enclaves like the military, the clergy, and the State Department are rife with homosexuality, no matter how secretive or repressed.  But this is not even the point of Brokeback Mountain, which is not a "gay cowboy movie" any more than Jaws is a fishing movie.Brokeback Mountain is a love story, specifically a story of forbidden love, and the horrifying emotional toll such a situation takes.  As with Legends Of The Fall, the real hero is Wyoming, Ang Lee has given us a loving, idyllic vision of the American West that seems to glow with purity and splendor.  (Let's protect it!)  Texas does not get off quite so easily, few people know better than writer Larry McMurty how god-awful flat, dry, and just plain miserable it is.  As to Annie Proulx, (just can't bear to add that affected E. in front of her name), whose story provided the foundation for the film, what can one say except that - wherever you find humanity's saddest qualities, darkest despair, and most senselessly cruel and violent tendencies, there you will find Ms. Proulx!  That's the spirit, Annie!Ledger's performance is haunting; his hurt seems to rise off him like steam.  Gyllenhaal, a terrific actor with a name that's hard to spell, is also outstanding, although his western twang does seem suspect at times.  Great supporting work by the wives.  Michelle Williams, as Alma Del Mar, is every bit as injured and silent as her husband, trapped and very sympathetic.  Anne Hathaway, as the Texas heavy equipment Princess, is perfection; there is a toughness to her that's very believable.The hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain was unfortunate, but inevitable.  Viewers who are able to put their homophobia in park for a couple of hours will discover a masterfully crafted film about two individual human beings attempting to find love in a world exquisitely designed to deny them access to it.  No matter what part of town you're from, that's always a heartbreaker.
Brokeback Mountain / B00005JOFQ*Spoilers*Somehow I missed watching Brokeback Mountain when it was first released and it's been on my "Things to Watch" list forever, and now I'm probably the last person on earth to watch it. Just about anything I can say about this wonderful movie seems woefully superfluous at this point, and yet it seems fair to point out that I'm yet another person taken in by this tragic and touching movie.I'm not usually a big fan of romances and tear-jerkers, largely because my tears are so easily jerked that I'm one of those people who cry during previews (especially theWall-Epreview, *sniffle*), and I can't say that I'm ever likely to return to Brokeback Mountain a second time, but that's not because I didn't enjoy the movie (far from it) but rather because this movie is memorable at a level comparable to searing itself onto one's brain matter. The writing is simply superb, the acting is quite possibly the best I've ever seen, and the plot is both simple and straightforward (forbidden love) while still being incredibly complicated and thought-provoking.It's hard to say what I liked most about this movie. I appreciated that Ledger's character wasn't given an 'easy out' in terms of his almost emotionally abusive behavior towards Gyllenhaal's character. Yes, the movie acknowledges powerfully that Ennis' behavior is driven by a guilt and fear that was instilled in him powerfully at a young age, but though Ennis is a victim, the movie does not insist that we hand him complete forgiveness for his treatment of Jack. Ennis is holding on to Jack because he loves him, and we pity him for being unable to embrace him fully, yet he seems blissfully, willfully blind to Jack's own pain at their near-constant separation, and Ennis is at fault for not making more time for his lover, or at least make his feelings plain and clear enough to ease some of Jack's pain and doubt.I also greatly appreciated the tenderness with which the movie approaches Ennis' wife and her feelings towards her husband's affair. It would have been tempting to cast her as all saint (understanding her husband's needs and accepting it without any feeling on her part) or as a convenient villain (thus making it morally 'acceptable' for Ennis to behave as he does), yet she is neither and the movie is better for it. As a human being, she struggles with her hurt over Ennis' adultery balanced against his steadfastness as a provider and father, if not as a loving husband. Even when her anger boils over, she never loses sight of the fact that she loves Ennis (as the father of her children, if nothing else), and she does not spread the rumors that he fears might literally end his life.I felt that the ambiguity over Jack's death was a careful touch. We are unsure whether the story of Jack's death was merely a cover for the murder Ennis imagines, and whether or not it is a figment of his imagination colors his acceptance of the matter. Was Jack's death a tragic event that he could have prevented by running off with him? Or would running off with him merely have put them both in further danger? It's impossible to say, and it's easy to imagine Ennis tormenting himself with this question for the rest of his life.Like pretty much everyone else on earth, it seems, I deeply recommend Brokeback Mountain for a tragic and touching tale of love and loss.~ Ana Mardoll
I rented this movie, not knowing what to expect. But this movie got to be good, I thought, since everyone loves it.What I can tell you is that good doesn't quite cover the level this film is on. This movie demonstrate true power! You will be deeply moved, emotionally, to the messages this movie conveys, and become magnetized to live out a better existence.
I've always heard good things about Brokeback Mountain so I always had an interest. Finally able to watch it I was not disappointed. This movie single handedly shows how hard it is having an 'undesirable way of life'. (I word it this way to include other crowds besides the homosexual crowd.) This is a movie everyone should see no matter their sexual orientation because it speaks for many causes.
PURPOSE: Validate the conjecture that a happy movie would be sad.GOAL: Show that a happy movie would be sad, using "Brokeback Mountain" as an example.DEFINITION: happy movie - one that invokes happiness or satisfaction within the viewer so as to cause him/her to reward it with no less than 5 stars.THEOREM: "Brokeback Mountain" is a happy movie.PROOF: Let us assume that "Brokeback Mountain" is a happy movie, then from our definition of happy movie, it follows that the viewer must reward it with no less than 5 stars. This implies that the movie has invoked happiness or satisfaction within the viewer. The viewer has awarded "Brokeback Mountain" with no less than five stars. This shows that "Brokeback Mountain" is a happy movie and our proof is complete.REMARK: The proof of our theorem that "Brokeback Mountain" is a happy movie only refers to a single viewer. However, this result of this proof is also applicable to multiple viewers. Furthermore, we can strengthen its validity if we use the fact that "Brokeback Mountain" has currently garnered over 900 customer reviews, a significant majority of which are no less than five stars. This implies that the movie has invoked happiness in not a single viewer, but multiple viewers.LEMMA: "Brokeback Mountain" is a sad movie.PROOF: Suppose that a sad movie is defined as one containing sad events or a sad ending. "Brokeback Mountain" is a movie containing a sad ending. From our definition of sad movie, it follows that "Brokeback Mountain" is a sad movie. This completes our proof.To show that "Brokeback Mountain" is a happy movie that would be sad, we can use the results of our proofs of the theorem asserting that "Brokeback Mountain" is a happy movie and the lemma asserting that "Brokeback Mountain" is a sad movie and combine their resolutions. For instance, we can use the fact that "Brokeback Mountain" is a sad movie containing a sad ending. which has garnered over 900 reviews from customers, the majority of which have five-star ratings. In spite of this, it contains a sad ending. The fact that "Brokeback Mountain" is a sad movie containing a sad ending further implies that such a movie is what is necessary for a movie to invoke happiness or satisfaction within the viewer(s), as demonstrated by the hundreds of five-star reviews that it has received from customers. This validates our conjecture that a happy movie would be sad, using "Brokeback Mountain" as an example.REMARK: Although we have shown that "Brokeback Mountain" is a happy movie which would be sad, we need to clarify any significant ambiguity concerning the nature of a sad movie. Recall our definition of sad movie, that is, one containing sad events or a sad ending. Examples of sad events or a sad endings can are inclusive of, but not limited to, the following: the death of a main character, a terrible epidemic that wipes out a majority of the characters featured in the story, instances of unsolved poverty, inevitable warfare, natural disasters capable of invoking widespread famine, etc. We leave it to the potential viewer of the film to investigate further examples of sad events or sad endings found in "Brokeback Mountain," lest we spoil crucial plot details.
I was floored. I was floored at what a beautiful love story this is, the tragedy that they had to hide for so long. As someone that is questioning her sexuality but have not yet arrived at a conclusion -- lesbian or straight -- this movie has instilled a sense of urgency in my heart... a sense that I don't want to deny or hide who I am anymore.Heath Ledgers performance was stunning. I am still crying.
I loved this movie so much I went back to see it the next day.  Heath Ledger's performance amazed me.  The scenery was beautiful and desolate.  It's a story of paths not taken and regret.
...than just a 'gay cowboy movie.'  But also just that.  Two rough and tumble, unschooled, primitive men of the American West come to learn painfully and ultimately, tragically, that  Marlboro men do indeed sometimes fall for each other...After some 756 reviews, one is hard pressed to say something refreshing about this film.  Yet, the sheer fact that discussion about BBM is so alive and thought-provoking attests to the greatness of this film as a piece of art.  Ang Lee has succeeded in creating something so visceral, so moving, so elusive and infinite in its meanings that twenty years from now, we'll still being try to decipher it.While some of the reviewers have referred to Jack and Ennis as 'unsympathetic' characters, I would rather use the word, 'human.' Yes, human.  A story about two deeply flawed and deeply scarred human beings who struggle to find a way to that which redeems us all: love.  Ennis and Jack's struggle is a universal one, that of loving somebody in the fullest and most elemental sense of the word.  That is why this film is for us all, regardless of sexual persuasion.  BBM is an epic tale about the costs of loving somebody whom your world, your family and even yourself deems to be unacceptable or just plain 'wrong.'From the minute we see them, Ennis and Jack are more than just gruff ranch hands thrown together by the whims of fate.  As he  gets out of his beat-up pick-up and very deliberately saunters(dare I say, sexily) towards an Ennis caught in the burn of his gaze, Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is out for something.  And that something just happens to be Ennis Del Mar.  As he spies Ennis through his side mirror whilst shaving, Jack is a man under a spell.  Unconciously or consciously, acting on his desire for Ennis is just a matter of time.  As both men move up the mountain, the ball between them starts to roll, picking up momentum with each gorgeous shot of the Canadian Rockies.  Ledger's Ennis wears the face of man fighting back every feeling he might have, and feelings for Jack especially.  But feelings and desire have 'no reins on them' as Ennis accurately points out.  Both characters slowly succomb to these feelings as their time on Brokeback passes.  Ang is the master of the tiny things that speak volumes. Whether its his intense concentration NOT to look at the naked Ennis or his child-like concern over Ennis' wounds, Jack indulges in his initial fascination and lets himself be ready for the moment.  And that moment soon comes with one of the most raw and REAL portrayals of homoerotic passion you'll see this side of pornography.  While born of the moment, Jack and Ennis' explosion is the culmination of their evolving and very unacknowledged desire for one another.  How this scene could have surprised and/or shocked anybody is beyond me.  All the signs were there, you just had to be looking.Like the black and white of a checkerboard, Ledger and Gyllenhaal complement each other like few other on-screen lovers have. Gyllenhaal's performance is nothing if not amazing.  How a straight actor could manage to capture Jack's open yearning for another man so perfectly, so precisely, is simply miraculous.  Jake's Twist is almost innocent in his near-joyful acceptance of the possibility that Brokeback offers.  He is the ennabler of the relationship, always looking for the road down the mountain where their fire can be continued. Yet, even Twist is confused by what this could all mean.  'Me neither,' he replies to Ennis' adamant declaration of not being 'queer.'  Part of the film's excruciating beauty is that both characters never really come to terms with who they are.  Men who love each other.No ride off here into the sunset. Ennis and Jack are the products of their time.  1963 America, where every man had to be JFK and every lady, Jackie.  And if you weren't, you'd best keep it to yourself, far in the closet, far from Mr. Kinsey.  More than that, BBM's world is rural, frontier, hardscrabble 1963 America where the mere idea of two men loving each other represents an assault on that most precious icon of Americana, the cowboy.  The laconic champion of simple goodness who stands for justice and defends the weak against the guys in black hats.  Falling in love with another cowboy ain't in the scipt and that's what makes Jack and Ennis' love so heroic, so fragile, so ultimately doomed.So you've had sex a couple of times with a buddy out in the boondocks and now it's time to come back into the rigid, heterosexual world of 1960's America. What's a queer cowhand to do?  Get married, sire a couple of kids and try to put it all behind you.  Jack and Ennis follow suit, but nature can't be held back.  Their first meeting after their marriages has to be one of the most passionate and tortured film 'kisses,' if that's the word one can use here, you'll ever see. Ledger and Gyllenhaal will leave you in a whirlwind.  As will Michelle William with her performance as Alma, Ennis' wife.  Alma's look of shock and disbelief as she stares through the glass window at her husband entwined in the arms and lips of another man is just one of the many grand cinematic moments in this film.  Alma's face is one of profound confusion. What just happened and what does it all mean?  Michelle Williams is indeed one of the highlights of BBM.  She doesn't need to say anything, her taut and pained expressions tell it all. A woman struggling to pick up the pieces of her shredded dream with dignity and self-respect.  Moreover, Ann Hathaway does a stellar job as Laureen Newsome, Jack's attractive Texas wife, a woman captivated by Twist's bull-riding prowess and boyish smile only to gradually learn what Alma knows early on.As the years drag by, both men settle for the costs and freedoms of the double life.  Fishing trips to Brokeback a couple times a year and then back to the lie with their women and families.  A lot has been mentionned already about the extreme damage both men cause their families.  And the claim is valid enough, if not too realistic.  Proulx and Lee wanted to show characters of THEIR time, crippled and blinded by THEIR circumstances, by THEIR environments and not least, by themselves.  After having witnessed the horrid aftermath of a hate crime as a young child, is it any wonder that Ennis has become a walking time bomb, striking out at anybody rather than admit he might not be all that different from the old rancher his father murdered.  Think about it people, most of us in Ennis' situation would have also strived for the so-called 'normal' life.Like Twain's Mississippi, Lee and Proulx's Brokeback is a mythical place.  Lee's masterful use of the West's untouched natural grandeur is without parallel.  Is not the mountain the third character in this relationship?  A place where the two lovers, like Adam and Eve, can act out their feelings in complete harmony with their surroundings.  A place unfettered by social constraint, tradition, expectation.  A place which allows Jack and Ennis to do that which should come most easily, to love.  Brokeback is a profoundly 'American' place, far from the maddening crowd, a place where self-limitation and painful compromise are unknown.  A place where it's all up to you to create your own heaven and/or hell.  Yet, such freedom comes at a heavy price. As Jack rightly says, 'Brokeback is all we got!'  What was once their playground of freedom, soon becomes their prison, their hideaway from the lies of their everyday lives.  Jack had the answer once.  He was willing to give this 'thing' a chance.  A ranch together, a life together...but Ennis's fear is just too much to overcome.  'Two men living together...if you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.'  And with such stoicism, Ennis nails the lid to both their coffins.  Denied the only one he ever really wanted, Jack looks elsewhere for his Ennis substitutes, which eventually lead to his ignominious murder.  Yet, could he have done otherwise?  Could he have been strong enough to forget Ennis Del Mar and cut off their relationship completely?  Are any of us strong enough to deny ourselves true love when it comes our way?  Is Ennis to blame for driving Jack to his death, for fostering his own emotional death due to his inability to conquer fear?  Who can judge? Certainly not us.  Such is the complexity of Ang Lee's art that it defies our natural desire to point the finger at the characters.Brokeback finishes on the same note it began, one of omnipresent sorrow and unbearable longing, longing destined to be unfulfilled. Shattered by Jack's murder and more importantly, by his own culpability in it, Ennis Del Mar has become a violent and empty shell of a man when his loving daughter, Alma Jr.(played brilliantly by newcomer Kate Mara), invites him to her wedding.  When asked whether her boyfriend truly loves her, she replies, 'Yes, Daddy, he does.' Ennis winces in pain, in regret at not having done like his daughter, at not having accepted love when it came his way.With Ennis's faintly voiced, 'I swear...,' a great American film closes.  And so much more than that.  A biting and gritty lesson on how lives should and should not be lived.  The reasons for watching BBM, repeatedly I might add, are many. More than anything, BBM should be seen and seen again as an example, par excellence, as to what a genius with a camera is capable of creating.  Ang Lee's visual poetry, similar to that of another maverick director, Terence Malick, is breathtaking.  Whether it be a single tear down a cheek, a look up at the camera in fear and confusion, icy red lips before the phone or the ultimate cowboy posing before the rocket's red glare, Lee manages to create scenes that will remain in you long after the lights are up.  Like a Hucklberry Finn of its day, Brokeback Mountain is more than just an indignant cry against injustices that remain with us still.  It's all that and so much more...
My 85 year old mom and I saw Brokeback Mountain a few days before the Oscars.  It was the only time in recent memory where, at the end of the screening, the theater was completely silent, and no one moved.  A powerful and achingly beautiful film. Five BIG stars for Brokeback Mountain.
The reason "Brokeback Mountain" is such a powerful movie is based on what isn't said, rather than what is.None of the major characters, Ennis and Jack, and their respective wives, know how to communicate with one another or even know how to make sense of their own feelings. The inexplicable love the men feel for one another and the growing bitterness of their wives due to emotional neglect are clear to the audience, but not to the characters themselves. This lack of communication is probably a universal trait affecting everyone at one time or another.This lack of communication leads to the final bittersweet realization for Ennis that a life lived for the sake of societal approval can be an empty life indeed and that if one allows outside influences to trump love, one may be left with only memories and yearnings of a life that might have been.And yet, Ennis grows and matures from his experiences. In a particularly poignant scene, Ennis gives up an important job so that he'll be free to attend his daughter's wedding. If Ennis's inability to deal with his emotions made him a distant father while his daughter was growing up, he has finally learned to value her love and acts accordingly.A scene between Ennis and Jack's mother is also particularly touching, since the non-verbal communication indicates a bond between them -- a shared love for Jack -- while Jack's antagonistic father looks on.There are many such scenes, but it would be difficult to touch upon all of them without giving too much away for those who haven't yet experienced this film.On a different topic, "Brokeback Mountain" is an important crossover movie. Although there are many gay-themed comedies and dramas, they seldom hit multiplex theaters. "Brokeback" is different in that it is a love story with universal appeal about the nature of love more than it is about love objects. And as such, its critical acclaim and awards (with more to come) are well deserved.I have one other general comment.  From reading through some of these reviews, it is apparent (and sad) that certain homophobic people who have not experienced "Brokeback Mountain" and probably never will, go through these reviews so that they can secretly vote on how "unhelpful" all the positive reviews are to them and then vote on how "helpful" the very few negative reviews are to them. If such people actually sat through the movie, it is just possible that some of their hatred and some of their fear might go away. If this were to happen, would it be such a terrible thing?
Mr. Lee has directed a romantic masterpiece for the 21st century with the magnificent Brokeback Mountain, creating an instant classic. A story that could possibly shock due to the two men looking and behaving as typical family men involved with women and children...who fall hard for each other. The perfectly cast leads not only excel in their acting but capture the essence of the intensely passionate relationship that seemingly develops out of the blue between two handsome,masculine,rugged cowboys hired to manage a flock of sheep in a spectacularly majestic mountain setting. An environment so outrageously romantic and isolated that it's impossible to imagine resisting any kind of attraction from occuring...between any two human beings.This beautifully handled film allows anyone who watches it to identify with the emotions of erotic attraction,electric passion, tender romance,internal conflict,dramatic tragedy and life changing loss that are a big part of the human experience. The elegant, leisurely pace and classic-mythic-cinematography heightens the gut-wrenching story as it unfolds.A stunning achievement in all catagories that sets a new standard for cinematic love-story-telling for the 21st century. A classic love between opposites that anyone can relate to and identify with ,opposites not in gender, but in personality and spirit. One cowboy is the optimistic extrovert who wants it all with his man by his side and the cowboy he falls for, is the emotionally tortured intovert....who owns the film from his first shot. Mr.Gyllenhaal and Mr.Ledger's on-screen couple has become a modern legend. It'll be a long time before anyone will be able to out do this work by a pair of intelligent, brave, extremely secure and gifted actors at the peak of their craft....who really understood and felt the characters and the difficulty of this very complicated, highly emotional situation. How fantastically refreshing to see homosexual desire portrayed by two very believably masculine young men with absolutely no trace of any theatrical, selfconcious, Will & Jack style-"gay" mannerisms. And in doing so, showing the world that there are plenty of "regular" men discreetly enjoying the "power of love/lust" privately with each other right under everyone's noses! Wishing Mr. Ledger's soul peace and love...he left us with a piece of work that will hopefully inspire people to seek  inner happiness by bravely facing one's inner, deeper truth. An important film for women to see to help them better understand those men who were never able to fully commit to them.
In watching this movie I was just in "awe" of the cinematography as well as the exceptional acting by these two men. Heath Ledger portrayed a conflicted individual struggling with life and his own emotions towards Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake played a great part, comfortable, confident in his feelings. I don't believe this movie surrounds the 'gay lifestyle' so much as it portrays many facets of these two mens lives and how they tried to 'fit in'.It showed courage, love, humility, strength and perseverance. Great Movie, Great Directing and especially Great Acting. Loved the movie.
My eyes are dried out now. Brokeback Mountain is the most beautiful and the most unforgetable movie of the year. Probably the best of all time. I feel fortunate to have seen it in my lifetime.
This movie really grabs you. The actors are excellent, and the story very decent, despite what people may think before they see it. A must see !
what a break through movietwo actors who were very very believableI watch this one over and overOne of my all time favorite movies and the director is amazing theCanadian mountains breathtaking too.Must must have this movie
I have loved this movie since it first came out--acting, scenery, plot.  One thing has bugged me though.  For a good production, they let it go out with what I consider a major mispronounciation in the ending song.  Maybe only a westerner would know, but the word in "get along little dogie" is pronounced with a long o--it means stray calf.  The singer says doggie, which is wrong.
*** This comment may contain spoilers ***I absolutely loved this movie. It touched my heart and soul in a profound way.It stayed with me for days and I could not stop mulling it over in my head. I have been trying to analyze why I (and others, from what I have been reading in chat boards etc.) have been experiencing such an intense reaction. Here is a partial explanation, from my point of view. I think that most people have experienced at one point in their lives, the intense, aching, longing love for another that cannot be fully realized, for whatever reason, as skillfully portrayed in Brokeback. This feeling touches the core of one's being and that feeling was palpable between the lead characters in Brokeback, even though it was not always explicitly expressed. The brilliant conveyance of such emotion is a tribute to the director and lead actors. My sense is that deeply connecting with the audience is what most serious actors and directors continually strive for in their work. To attain it to this extent is remarkable and laudable and what makes this movie "great." A few random observations: While watching the movie, I had hoped that Ennis would open up and express his affection and feelings more readily. Upon reflection, though, I have realized that such emoting would not be true to the character, who was conflicted, fearful and raised in a environment that was not generally hospitable to men expressing themselves in such a manner, especially with another man. The lack of verbal expression, though, did not prevent the feelings from being conveyed, at least to the audience. Also, I was surprised how strongly I felt for Ennis' wife and how difficult it must have been for her to live in the situation, knowing what she did. I also could feel Jack's frustration, due to the fact that he was more ready and less inhibited than Ennis to move forward with their relationship.I left the theater somewhat morose, but took away an uplifting life lesson as well, which was the central message of the movie, for me. That is, to not let fear inhibit love in your life, in whatever form it may appear.
This DVD arrived at my mailbox on Thursday, but I have not had the time to watch it until today. After watching it, I am deeply impacted by the tragedy this film presents, and the beauty of this film.This movie shows how innocent love can start out to be, and how twisted the world can make it in the end. The most important part about this movie is how the characters are forced into marriage, but had to manage to their love. There is no other word to describe this movie, as it demonstrate true beauty, and humanity.
Ang Lee's film, Brokeback Mountain, is one of those rare events that impacts not only the entertainment industry and its supporters, but also impacts our society by revealing truths of the human heart that may run counter to society's prescriptions and rules.It is a love story beween two men that emerges out of a totally unlikely place, the cowboy world of windswept Wyoming in 1963. Yet from those first dusty scenes where Ennis del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal)are hired to herd sheep, we begin to see a beautiful world of high mountain pastures on Brokeback Mountain, where the pressures of society and civilization can be left behind and gradually these two men can shed the confines of prejudice and social roles and experience first physical and then emotional love for each other. To a certain extent, high above the world of civilization, in a more natural state, these two young men enter an Eden. It is a Garden of Eden first in its natural beauty and then second in the love that is allowed to flourish there. I use the term Eden because throughout the film, Ennis and Jack try to return there - to recapture the young love they felt for each other, and to meet their sexual needs.But civilization calls, and these two young men return to the lowlands, collect their pay, and painfully part ways. Ennis hits a brick wall with his bare fist in a hidden alley, for he is a man who is more comfortable with physical pain than emotional pain.  Jack returns to the worksite the following year, eager to relive the experience, but stopped by Randy Quaid, the foreman, as well as Ennis' decision not to show up again.Both men marry. Ennis marries a vulnerable country girl reared from the same strong stock of no-illusion people from which he was reared. Jack almost starves until he is picked by a rich cowgirl who has been denied nothing by her father. Anne Hathaway plays the wife of Jack. What is it about the man who desires other men that appears mysterious and unobtainable to some women? Part of the dynamic between Anne and Jack is that she is a young woman who has been given everything, yet she marries a man with a hidden ability to love inside that she will never be able to touch, she will only always remain aware that it is there and it is not meant for her.Michelle Williams plays Ennis' wife, Alma. Some of the most painful scenes of the film involve Alma as she gradually begins to learn the secrets of the silent man she has married. After 4 years, Jack writes a postcard to Ennis, asking if he would like to get together. Ennis responds and a date is determined. On the day that Jack is supposed to arrive, Ennis is a bundle of bad nerves, pacing, sad and fearful of a no-show, restless, depressed as a way to deal with his repressed longing, energized, agaitated at the kids, and this odd state of mind/body is certainly observed by his sensitive young wife. When Jack arrives, Ennis runs out of the house to greet him, pulls him from his truck, and the two men kiss with a flood of repressed love and lust and longing. Yet Alma opens the front door and observes this embrace and knows that this is a passion she has never experienced with Ennis.Jack Twist, played superbly by Jake Gyllenhaal, emerges as the character that is most emotionally available. He makes himself available to Ennis and is the most open to these two men divorcing their wives and becoming life partners. He is aware of his needs and has sex with other men beside Ennis. He is the one who continually pushes Ennis to experience the hidden rumblings of the heart.Ennis del Mar, played perfectly by Heath Ledger, is an emotionally more complex and stunted character. Yet it is the character growth of Ennis that in some ways is the real trajectory of the story. The trajectory of this story is not boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finally find boy again. It is rather a more complex path of self awareness where pain is the surgical tool that reveals Ennis to himself. He does lose Alma, he does lose Jack, but in the end we see a changed man. When an available attractive young woman begins to seduce him, he is pulled into her orbit due to his need for comfort from his loses. HOwever, he realizes he will never be happy with this young woman and she will never be fulfilled with him. He ends the budding romance in a way that tells us he has gained in wisdom and self knowledge. In the end we see Ennis as a wounded and broken fellow, destined to mourn the love he could have nourished and experienced, and yet we see him begin to celebrate the budding love of his eldest daughter.This is mature matter. We all make poor or uninformed or unconscious choices. We all treat life as if it would go on forever and we don't need to make hard choices because we will always get a second chance. These two men were not especially strong heroic fellows, they were victims of societal pressures and their own emotional boundaries and awareness. Sometimes we do our best to understand ourselves and the world and it still comes out a tragedy. Knowing this, we must be grateful for those times of communion of the heart, which come to us like grace, like an unsought gift, but which transforms us forever.
This movie is LONG over due, it is about time that ther is a movie that shows the other side of gay life. As a Idaho ranch boy I have long been involved with the western way of life. It is nice to see a movie that does not make all gay men look like the sterotypical.It is nice to see that the main stream public can finally realize yes there are gay men who like to be around horses and yes we do rodeo and yes we live our lives in a manor that it is not the "normal" gay life. We all do not live in big cities we do not all dress flamboyant and we do not all act overlty Effeminate.
What can I say?  A damn good film from an even better book.  Covers the territory well, if a bit too dramatic in a few places.  I found it moving.  In time I will watch it again.
Wonderful movie. It reminded me of a Romeo and Juliet story. I'll be buying it the day it comes to DVD. Excellent.
When Jack is standing by the campfire, Innis comes up behind him and puts his arms around him.  Innis says with, great tenderness. "Come Jack, You're like an old horse, asleep on your feet."  Innis is unable to show emotion unless it is torn out of his gut.  This moment shows what Innis would have been, his true self, if his life had been different.  This if one of the defining moments of the film for me.  His parents had died and his siblings didn't have room for him.  And, of course, his father showed his children awful things.  This is not to say that he wouldn't have been homosexual.
Everyone is reviewing the movie - it's incredibly hard NOT to, but having bought an advance copy of the DVD today (legal), AND having seen the movie, I'm glad to say the DVD transfer is gorgeous - they did it right.  Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is breathtaking and spectacular, while at the same time being almost Zen-like in its unhurried beauty and tranquility.  "Brokeback Mountain" is destined to be among "Dances With Wolves," "The English Patient," "Out Of Africa," "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord" and other sweeping, epic visual classics.  This film deserves to be watched on as BIG a screen as possible for its sheer, scenic beauty alone. I haven't seen "The Memoirs Of A Geisha," (which won the Oscar for Cinematography), but they should have declared it a tie.  I was a little disappointed to discover that the film was shot at some of the highest points in Calgary, Alberta (Canada) - couldn't director Ang Lee find the same majestic beauty here in the good ol' U.S.A.?  And, if Universal Studios is listening, though the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is excellent, DTS sound on this DVD would have been outstanding.  I'm sure the out-takes would have been a lot of fun to see as well!  A few music videos (the score won an Oscar), could have been included.  Maybe all of these and more in the "Special 2-DVD Collector's Edition?"Since we're in Oscar territory, having seen both "Capote" and "Brokeback Mountain," while Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance was undeniably brilliant, (IMHO), Heath Ledger deserved to win Best Actor for his remarkable, INCREDIBLY understated and restrained portayal of Ennis Del Mar (still, all the while ticking underneath like an emotional time-bomb.)  Larry McMurtry (co-writer of the screenplay), wrote to Ang Lee and mentioned (between actual cowboys), "how important the non-verbal communication was just as important as what is spoken."  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal GOT that completely - and they DIDN'T learn it from "Cowboy Boot Camp," where they both actually went to prepare for their roles.  Their commitment was bringing the script to life (and the love between their characters contained within), as often what is NOT spoken between them means as much as what IS - for example, the tender way Ennis embraces Jack from behind by the fire, quietly telling him, "You're going to fall asleep like a horse standing up," then gently rocking and humming to him.  Scenes like that are repeatedly and each time beautifully conveyed not only by them, but by ALL of the outstanding actors.  Michelle Williams as Alma (Ennis' wife), deserves special mention - a superb "quiet storm" throughout, the look on her face when Ennis is about to "go fishing" with Jack the first time is worth a thousand words.  When he closes the door to leave, you can see AND feel all of her hurt and pain as her world (and the man she thought she knew), is literally turned upside-down.Next, on a lighter note, let me put to rest the answer to a burning question on MANY people's minds, "Was that Jake and Heath jumping off the cliff (naked?)"  Upon careful frame-by-frame inspection, the answer is no, they were BOTH doubles.  (That's okay.  Some things are better left to the imagination!)  :-)In the DVD extras, it was very interesting to discover that screenplay co-writers Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry were trying to get this film made for years (since the debut of the short story in 1997), "but no one would touch it." (It was known as "The Greatest Unproduceable Screenplay Ever Written.")  Focus Films producer James Schamus also said (when he was an independent producer), "I wanted to produce this film for years, but the world wasn't ready for it."  And how Diana and Larry used virtually EVERY sentence in Annie Proulx's thirty page short story of "Brokeback Mountain" in their screenplay, then "fleshed out the characters' lives," to bring it to fifty pages - and then had to "make up the rest," as they needed twice as much for the movie (and the flawless job they did winning them a well-deserved Oscar.)  What was most touching though, was what they said upon its release: "We are stewards of the story.  It's like raising a child, you hope the child is accepted and successful, and you send it out into the world and it ceases to be yours.  It becomes everyone's story."The DVD interviews show it was so very obvious how EVERYONE involved in this film TRULY viewed it as a labor of love, and what drew everyone to it was the honesty of the characters in the script that made every perfectly cast actor want to bring their role to life (so brilliantly, I might add - after seeing it, you can't imagine ANYONE being anyone else but who they ARE in the movie!)  As Heath Ledger said, "I always like to try and bare my soul a little bit."  Jake Gyllenhaal added, "I'm always looking for films that go after an emotional journey."  When Ennis DOES bare his soul - when Jack leaves him at the end of their first season on Brokeback, and he doesn't expect the rush of feeling of emptiness he feels; when Jack tells him, "I wish I knew how to quit you, Ennis Del Mar," and Ennis tells him to "go ahead and LEAVE me alone," then completely and totally breaks down, emotionally and physically, because that's the LAST thing he wants Jack to do; when he visits Jack's room, then discovers how much and how deeply Jack always loved him (and in its symbolism, always wanted to protect and take care of him), to name only a few, are nothing short of completely DEVASTATING, and in these moments YOU are experiencing the same "emotional journey" Jake Gyllenhaal so accurately described without even THINKING about it.  To become so enamoured with these characters (their lives and their surroundings), that you didn't even know you were being seduced - therein lies the real beauty of "Brokeback Mountain" - and a testament to the labor of love from everyone who brought it from thirty pages to the screen.In this epic, all-American love story that knows no preferences, boundaries or gender (only that of love itself), everyone can take that "emotional journey" that Jake and everyone succeeded in making with this timeless, outstanding film and DVD release. Not only will Heath Ledger (who tragically left us all too soon in 2008), be remembered for an Oscar-worthy performance and one that will always remain a legacy of his, "Brokeback Mountain" is destined and deserves to become an American classic and legacy that thankfully, the world finally seems ready for.
This is an amazing story of love.  It definitely does the book justice.  Great story, great actors.  I love it!
Now that the hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain has started to die down, one can get past all of the superlatives heralding Ang Lee's film as a classic and all of the jokey puns on the film's title and concentrate on what makes it really work: the love story between two men. Much was made about it being the first mainstream movie about gay cowboys but it was also an achievement for Lee that he was able to bounce back from the commercial and critical disappointment that was Hulk.Heath Ledger has gone from teen comedies like 10 Things I Hate About You to such diverse roles as the ones in Lords of Dogtown and The Brothers Grimm. This performance may be his finest yet. It is a very internalized one. Ennis doesn't communicate very much verbally but rather through physical gestures and by his eyes. It also doesn't hurt that Ledger has the rugged good looks that are ideal for this role.Jake Gyllenhaal turns in yet another excellent performance as a hopeless romantic stuck in a marriage with someone he doesn't truly love. One gets the feeling that the time away from Ennis affects him the most but it is only because it is visible in the way he acts and in his eyes. He's the one who pushes hardest from the two of them to discard their traditional lives and be together all the time. However, as the film progresses, we begin to realize that their time apart hurts Ennis just as much - he just keeps it bottled up inside.There is a touching intimacy to Jack and Ennis' relationship. It isn't just physical, it is also about companionship. When you spend that amount of time with someone you get to know them really well. It is the kind of relationship that changes the course of their lives. Ultimately, Brokeback Mountain is a tragic love story - even more so because we get to know Jack and Ennis so well. We become emotionally invested in their lives and we know that they can never be together in the way that they would like. Ang Lee's film is one of those rare ones that actually does live up to its hype and definitely worth a look."On Being a Cowboy" takes a look at the cowboy camp that the actors went through so that they could get an idea of what that kind of life was like and portray it convincingly on camera. Ledger actually grew up on a farm and had plenty of experience riding horses."Directing from the Heart: Ang Lee" is a love fest for the director. The cast praise his direction and talk about how much they admire him."From Script to Screen: Interviews with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana" features the two screenwriters talking about their first reaction to Annie Proulx's short story that first appeared in the pages of The New Yorker.Finally, there is "Sharing the Story: The Making of Brokeback Mountain" that originally aired on the Logo channel. It follows your typical making of featurette that mixes interview soundbites with clips from the movie. This is a nice if not superficial look at the movie.
I saw Brokeback four times in the a movie cinema . Why, because for the first time I saw my story on the screen. Being from a small town where everyone knows everyone. Being gay was not something you wanted people to know even in the 80s...so you find the dark places where maybe no one will see you..the Brokeback Mountains in our small towns. Thanks to all that made BM possible...maybe some young person will see it and not have to wait 20 plus years to know we will never go back to BM! And, don't ask don't tell is anti-America. (2011)
So many people that I know have stopped themselves from seeing this movie because of the hot-button issue it presents to its viewers.  But honestly, get over it.  This is such a beautifully done movie, from the transcription of the short story to the silver screen to the expansive shots. Such a little thing as the word "gay" should never stop anyone from seeing this.I'm a big fan of Heath Ledger's since A Knight's Tale, but I wasn't so much of a fan of Jake Gyllenhall's till I saw this.  Their acting is absolutely superb, and came completely from the heart.  They were each very expressive, and I didn't even feel as though I was watching a movie--I felt like I was right there with them, experiencing what they felt.It doesn't matter that they are both men.  It's love--we've all felt it before, in one way or another.  It's heartbreaking, it's wonderful, and it's impossible to live without, and this movie shows that rollercoaster ride perfectly.I enjoy watching westerns too, and I don't think that this destroyed any of the wonderful history that westerns have.  That's such a closed-minded way to think.  Rather, I think this movie paid homage to westerns and cowboys alike--I have a new respect for how tough real cowboys are, after seeing the work these two ranch hands had to accomplish for practically no pay!  This movie by no means tries to express that all cowboys are gay.All in all, this is a heart warming story that's wonderfully told and done.  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about after reading the short story--while I thought the story was good, I never thought it could be retold this well on the silver screen.  Honestly one of the best "book-to-movie" flicks I've ever seen.  Great casting, believable acting and breathtaking shots.  Don't miss this one.  It's beautiful.
I saw this movie three months ago, and there is not a day that goes by where I do not think of this movie.  I am not gay, but the story touched me soooo much. Everything about this movie is perfect...the breathtaking cinematography, the touching,simple score that contrasts with the complex feelings of the characters, the brilliant acting, and the flawless script.  Two of the scenes, when Ennis talks to Lureen on the phone, and when Ennis visits Jack's parents, are about as close to film mastery as you can get.  What I love about this movie is that it is so so complex, the characters, including the wives, are so incredibly rich.  Ang Lee does an amazing job with every little detail, from the bit of red nail polish on Lureen's finger during that phone call to the speckled pot that Jack's mother uses, to the different color hats that the two characters wear-Jack wears a black hat and Ennis a white, showing their ying-yang connection- Lee has truly created a GEM of a movie. The biggest praise goes to Annie Proux, whose short story was lovely. I will say this however, I loved the movie even more the second time, I just noticed so many more things.  Anyway, to sum it all up, SEE THIS MOVIE, it has touched me in a way that few recent films have.I just can't seem to quit Brokeback Mountain!!:)
The story itself is quite a journey, and if you can open your heart and empathize just a tiny bit you'll find it both devistating and captivating.But beyond the story itself, this movie has so many layers of meaning and subtlety that Ang Lee and the incredible cast have added to the amazing screenplay.  I cannot recommend this movie enough!
The Movie:Brokeback Mountain is about two men who work together one summer in extreme isolation. They form a deep bond during their time there and eventually sleep together. Because homosexuality is not accepted in their time and place (1960's Wyoming), they deal with conflicted emotions and go their seperate ways into marriages. While married, they reunite from time to time, taking trips to Brokeback Mountain where they continue an on-again, off-again affair lasting several years.The two men feel differently about their relationship. Ennis (Heath Ledger) cannot bring himself to terms with it, and feels that it must always be hidden, in the shadows. His marriage suffers cruelly from it. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), however, wants to embrace their relationship more fully (ironically, perhaps, he has the better family life, though it is always hollow for him). Ultimately, their relationship ends tragically. Ennis' family dissolves and Jack is beaten to death on account of his homosexuality.The film is quiet and powerful. The score and backdrops are sweeping and majestic. The acting is top-notch. The direction, excellent. The emotions, real. However one feels about the subject matter, this is a great film.Its Reactions:I have found the reactions to this film to be quite surprising. Friends, of whom I had never suspected any sort of bigotry, refused to go see it and only spoke of it with either irony or derision in their voices. And we can see in the reviews of this film here on Amazon (and the helpful/unhelpful votes) that it has provoked something intense and deeply-seated in many people.It is my opinion that love is love (though, so the reader understands my personal context, I am both a straight man and politically conservative). I understand that some others feel that the portrayal of homosexual love is part of some "agenda"--they call it propaganda--but I don't think that, just because a movie presents a different point of view than your own, it makes it somehow sinister or manipulative. I hope that everyone here who takes the time to rate these reviews or write their own has taken time to watch the film, prior to commmenting on it. I think that the film, itself, proves that it is not out to manipulate or "change society" except in the ways that art always does, by "holding the mirror up" and allowing us to examine ourselves.Obviously, this was an important movie to make. The reactions prove it. While I had suspected that society was a little more sophisticated than to go crazy over a film like this, I was wrong. This is a dialogue we need to have. And so, to those who've seen the film and still wish to attack it, I actually want to thank you: while I disagree with what you believe, and the reasons you have for your attacks, its good that we have a chance to talk about it.Five stars for the film itself and five stars for the important discussion it has launched.
This movie was very good.  I think it deserves a lot of attention from the awards for best movie and actor.  I hope many see this film, it has taken on new territory.
What a great transcultural, transgender,transunderstanding piece of cinematography. Whether you are gay, straight, or undecided, this is a story about love, the emotion, removing all sexual connotations from its definition. It is the form of love that could happen between two men, as it is represented in the movie, but in its broader sense it is the form of love that can happen between any two people. It is easy to empathize with the loveless wife who sits in the shadows, but maybe one should look at the suffering of all three leads. After all it is not one, but three people who remain unfulfilled, because of the restraints put upon them by a society that tries to define love in what might be a too-limited fashion. To it all add beautiful cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack. If you are watching it with the one you love, or wishing for a love so pure, then watch it...it is very inspirational on many levels. It is hard to imagine a short 65-page story coming together into such a wonderful two hours of sheer entertainment.
Beyond words. But ... an attempt: beautifully filmed, incredibly acted, leaves you connected with the human condition, love, hate and the dreams that never quite come true.
OK, so we've heard all the hype about this flick. Affectionately dubbed the "gay cowboy movie," viewers everywhere giggle naughtily whenever it's mentioned. However, those who cannot get past that will seriously be remiss in viewing one of the most powerful love stories of all time.This is the story of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two cowboys who meet each other in the summer of 1963 deep in the mountains of Wyoming. They are both hired to herd and protect a large flock of sheep through the mountains for several months. Every day their friendship progresses little by little as they spend the summer working with only one another. One night they are shocked to discover that their friendship had transformed them into lovers. This begins a tumultuous relationship that spans twenty years of broken relationships, deception, and ultimate tragedy.This film is amazing in every sense of the word. It is beautifully directed and executed. The stunning cinematography displays the stark beauty of the American wilderness that mirrors the wild, untamed love between Ennis and Jack.Heath and Jake's performances were legendary. I honestly have never seen better performances from two straight male actors in terms of heartrending, accurate portrayals of homosexual men during a critical time of the history of American society. This is a story that is moving and haunting. It stays with you and reverberates through your soul for a long time. It is a movie that will continue to affect me because it revealed to me the brutality of human nature, and how love is so powerful that it has the might to act simultaneously as salvation and destruction to so many lives. Absolutely amazing.
After seeing the movie "Brokeback Mountain", I was truly moved by the powerful love story between the two main characters, Jack and Ennis. This is one of the few films that kept me thinking days later. To me, there is nothing more refreshing than a movie that "takes a risk". This film was beautifully captivating in every way, and certainly portrays what it is to be in love, no matter what the circumstance. I guarantee that after watching this film, you will feel strongly about what you just witnessed, for me, the feelings were extremely positive. The bottom line is that this movie is really an experience, no matter what your opinions are on the subject matter.
A Brilliant film.Love has no rules and springs on you when you least expect it.There's passion, yearning and heartaches in this epic story.Go for it!!! You will love it.
This film is a great Alternative Love story that can touch your heart if your willing to keep an open mind. This film has won several awards, and is well worth the cost of owning it. Not for the close minded or faint of heart. However if you are an open minded hopless romantic then you will love this wonderfull film.
Never has there been a movie that has stuck with me for this long. After i saw the movie, all i could think about was how unbelievably depressing this movie was. These men, are just two guys who happen to fall in love with each other. And this doesnt seem to be the kind of love we have today. This is soulmate, eternal love...the kind that seems it will go on for ever. And then this tragedy happens. (And Heath Ledger's acting in this part was incredible). You really start to think about how much he wanted to live his life with Jack, but he couldnt because he was afraid that it end in one of their deaths, but it still does. And i thought that maybe if they had had their life together, this might not have happened, and that's the tragic thing. This movie has really made an impact on the people who have seen it. Some people are too narrow minded to see beyond the "boringness" of the movie. Not all movies have to be action packed to be good.
I recall a short story version of Brokeback Mountain many years ago in a major periodical (alas, I can't recall the periodical). I had an idea that it would, in the fullness of time, become a major motion picture, and that it has. It is an award-winning film already, and looks set for some sort of Oscar recognition.  The film has garnered more Oscar nominations than any other this year.However, in the hype surrounding the film, those interested would be wise to look at the book. There is much more depth here than in the film, much more about the interior workings of the main characters and what they must endure. This is ultimately not a love story, as the marketing has been spinning the film, but rather an expose on the dangers and drawbacks of living in the closet. For the purposes of this story, Annie Proulx has juxtaposed two diametrically opposite cultures in the American psyche - the gay culture and the cowboy culture (although history is, as it often is, in fact rather different from what the Hollywood-created current remembrance of it is). One comes to wonder at the resistance that all characters seem to have for breaking free of their bonds; ultimately, none of the relationships are satisfying, and there is an emotional desolation as wide and spare as brush land and prairies of the American West.The lead characters meet while working for the summer as wranglers and watchers over herds. They form a bond that renews at regular intervals during their lives, lives that go on to other, more traditional and socially acceptable settings. Each gets married, each has children, each embarks (in one way or another) in a working life that would seem to preclude the other, but yet the tie that binds them draws them together again on a regular basis.The closet theme is heightened in the lead characters, but in fact serves as a metaphor for readers who might not fit in that particular closet - we all have skeletons in our closets, it seems, and in fact, we all have our own closets in which we hide and live out part of our lives.This theme is played in out in several scenes of the film - Ennis Del Mar finding his shirt intertwined with Jack's shirt in Jack's closet, which Ennis then proceeds to put into his own closet.The last scene is perhaps the most powerful of all, drifting to a final image.  Ennis' daughter, having announced her marriage plans, drives off into the dusty plain; Ennis is living in isolation in his own trailer which has next to no furniture (his daughter comments that he needs a chair); and the very final shot is of a closet door, kept closed until Ennis is alone, with a view of the mountains in the far distance just outside the window beyond.In terms of overall cinematography, this is a beautiful film.  Ang Lee's direction has provided wonderful panoramic views of the mountains and the plains, the not-so-wild west of America, mid-century.  This is a world very different from either coast - the trends of the cities in New England and California have little effect on life here, which goes on generation after generation with an unrelenting sameness.Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal, fresh from his role as a marine in 'Jarhead') and Heath Ledger (whose film 'Casanova', playing at the same time in the same cinema in my town, cast him in a very different role) play the leads of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar, two down-on-their-luck wranglers who get a summer job camping out with sheep herds in the mountains - the kind of 24 hour/7 day-per-week job that virtually nobody wants.  Jack is the extrovert, whereas to call Ennis an introvert might win the Oscar for understatement.  At one point, Jack points this out, after a conversation that only lasted for about a minute.Jack Twist: 'That's more words than you've spoke in the past two weeks.'Ennis Del Mar: 'Hell, that's the most I've spoke in a year.'Ledger's portrayal of Ennis is remarkable in that Ennis seems to be almost inarticulate.  Everything is said in a grumble, a low-level, low-syllable-count manner.  Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Jack as the ants-in-his-pants, high-energy bronco buster cowboy is also very enthralling.  Jack's passion for many things comes through, and through the film we come to discover (as Ennis comes to discover) that this passion comes with a high price.Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams play the wives of Jack and Ennis, respectively.  Both want 'regular' lives, and both discover there is more to their husbands' relationship than fishing-buddy friendship in different ways.  In some ways, the film reminded me of another film, 'Same Time Next Year', in which a couple gets together on a regular basis while maintaining stable, family relationships elsewhere.  However, there is a price to be paid for leading such double lives, and we see this manifested in different ways in the lives of Ennis, Jack, and their wives and children.  Again, the issue of the closet comes into play.Of course, the big 'issue' for the film is homosexuality and homophobia.  That this takes place within the almost-sacred genre of the American Western also adds to the heightened interest - the mythology of the American cowboy being a super-macho figure has already been developed as a gay stereotype by such groups as the Village People and what sociologists might call costume-culture communities.  The unspoken secret that rarely made even a mention on Hollywood screens was that cowboys, being isolated much of the time, and in male-only communities when they did have company, almost certainly had a higher incidence of same-sex expression than we have come to believe through the mythology.Ennis and Jack do put physical and emotional expression to their passion and to their love for each other, but societal expectations and personal feelings (what some term internalised homophobia) work to keep them apart and leading separate (and dual) lives throughout the twenty-year span of the film.There is no happy ending to this film - I left the cinema with a feeling about as desolate as the dry and dusty plains shown in many of the scenes.  I found bits of the music score coming back to me for days afterwards, and each time this happened, I would feel a bit more sombre, and a little bit lost for words.  The original themes by Gustavo Santaolalla and Marcelo Zarvos are very well done, and this is a soundtrack I mean to get.I won't predict that it will win the best picture Oscar, but I am not surprised it is one of the odds-on favourites for winning.
Great movie. Probably the best movie this year. Great story and not because of the "gay cowboy" storyline. Actually once you start watching the movie, the "gay" part doesn't even come into mind, if you give the movie a true chance. The scenery is amazing and the acting is truly award winning. Definietly recommend this movie to others.
Brokeback Mountain is a powerful a movie that takes the audience on a beautiful but sad emotional roller-coaster ride. It is a tragic romance in the vain of Romeo and Juliet, or is that Romeo and Romeo. Take out the petty, feuding Montagues and Capulets and substitute the vicious stereotypes of 1960's Middle America, complete with gay bashing, homophobia, and self-doubt. This movie is shocking commentary on how far we have come and, if you want to know how far we still have to go, just look to the movie's R rating. There is nothing in this movie that deserves the R rating. It is given that rating solely for the reason that the two main characters are both males. There is very little sex and nothing particularly graphic. It is simply a love story. It is sad that our society is so quick to show children men killing each other, yet so hesitant to show them falling in love.
My partner and I went to see the movie twice.  Very well done.  As a once married man now in a gay relationship I can relate to both characters.  I purchased the DVD as soon as it came out.A must for anyones DVD library.
This is probably one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.  It stays with you long after it ends.  It makes you look at the choices you make in your life.I really loved this movie!!
This is the greatest gay movie that has ever been made in my opinion. It is heartwarming, romantic, and sad towards the end when Jack got killed by those awful straight dudes he got messed up with. I was really hoping that Ennis and Jack would have been with each other for the reast of their lives because I could tell they really loved each other in spite of their rocky start.
If you peel away the controversy, look past the fact that this film should have won the Best Picture Oscar, and forget the late-night Comedic jabs, you indeed are left with a wonderful, quiet film. Devoid of any exploitation and containing little violence, "Brokeback" emerges as a wonderfully written, skillfully directed story of two men, circa 1963 that are unable to share their love openly. The performances range from excellent (Jake Gyllenhaal and - especially Michelle Williams) to the amazing, career-defining performance of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar. Known beforehand as a pretty-boy Austrailian Actor, Mr. Ledger masterfully keeps Ennis Del Mar's emotions as tight as a balled-up fist as he is incapable of to show Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist the depth of his love. The final 30 minutes of this film are as wrenching and honest as anything committed to film. Don't miss this film
I had a chance to catch Brokeback Mountain.  I find one word to describe the movie----INCREDIBLE!  Highly recommended to those with an open mind, and can somehow relate to two men being in love.  The movie is tragic, yet rewarding.  One can relate to the "living a lie" scenario as it is so common today.  Even those who opose the gay life style need to give credit to an outstanding director, excellent cast, and most of all the beautiful scenery, which is a pleasant change from the congested, and urban setting.  I am eager to own this movie.  I would encourage people to see it, as it is a reminder to appreciate what, and who you have, because you never know when it, or who you have may be taken away from you.  I would have much rather have seen a happy ending, but life isn't always about happy endings.  It's just life, and this movie will tear at your heart.  I for one would like to see more movies like  this one.
Yep, the best film so far this century. The best on every level; the story, the screeplay, the directing, the acting the cinematography, the soundtrack all come together to create a film far greater than the sum of it's parts.
"Brokeback Mountain" finally arrived in Tallahassee on January 6.  Was it worth the wait?  Yes, it was.  The film, an adaptation of a story by Annie Proulx, is a thing of beauty.  Exceptionally faithful to the source material, Ang Lee, director or of the gay comedy "The Wedding Banquet" (among many other notable films), has fashioned a classic love story - one I feel sure will endure.  Why am I so confident?  Because rather than being groundbreaking, I found the story to be a simple variation on the classic formula which has fate conspiring against a pair of lovers.Is it really groundbreaking in 2006 for a film to depict the passionate love between two men?  The Fundamentalists are acting like this is our first time at the rodeo.  The truth is that we've been seeing films as explicit as this one for three decades.  In 1971 (thirty-five years ago!) staright actors Peter Finch and Murray Head played a passionate love scene in "Sunday, Bloody Sunday."  1982 saw Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean lock lips in "Making Love."  In 1985 Manuel Puig's "Kiss of the Spider Woman" was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, and William Hurt won Best Actor as the film's openly gay protagonist.  In 1987 we saw the landmark Merchant/Ivory adaptation of E. M. Forster's "Maurice," a love story that featured not only a happy ending, but James Wilby and Rupert Graves in a simulated sex scene which included full frontal nudity.  Has the Radical Right forgotten about the love scenes and nudity in "Love! Valor! Compassion!," "Angels in America," "Wilde" or the deservedly controversial "Priest"?Over the past three decades there has been a virtual explosion of films dealing with gay people: "Torch Song Trilogy," "My Beautiful Launderette," "Prick Up Your ears," "Longtime Companion," "Philadelphia" (for which Tom Hanks won the Best Actor Oscar), "Gods and Monsters," "Jeffrey," "High Art," "Boys Don't Cry" (for which Hilary Swank won the Best Actress Oscar), "Before Night Falls," "Far From Heaven," "The Laramie Project," "Capote," "Breakfast on Pluto," "Mysterious Skin" and "Transamerica," to name but a few.  Other gay inclusive Best Picture Oscar nominees have included: "Midnight Cowboy" (which won the award in 1969), "Cabaret," "Dog Day Afternoon," "The Crying Game," "Four Weddings and a Funeral," "The Full Monty" and "The Hours."There's an old show business adage that says "any publicity is good publicity."  Perhaps films like "Brokeback Mountain" would never achieve "must see" status without the Radical Right calling special attention to them, without which they would simply come and go with little or no fanfare.  Though I can't figure out why "Brokeback Mountain" should be considered either controversial or groundbreaking, I highly recommend it, and would love to see it win this year's Oscar for Best Picture.  Now THAT would be groundbreaking.
BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a great movie. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall give great performances throughout the movie. The scenery in this movie is beautiful (filmed right here in Alberta). The movie is an emotional journey of two men who work together one summer herding sheep, and ultimately fall in love. They go on to live seperate lives and get married and have kids, but always come back to each other every year when they'd go to Brokeback Mountain. Michelle Williams is great, playing Ennis' (Ledger) wife. This is a great movie. I was really touched and moved by it.
Archie Bunker's command to stifle YOURSELF! was and is society's command to all those in every walk of life who won't/can't "conform" and are forced to choose between destroying  themselves in order to "fit" or literally and figuratively being cast out.  Brokeback Mountain clearly shows the tragic price exacted not only from the lovers but from all the characters involved. The story, mirrored by the magnificent setting, was both wonderful and chilling because of it's undeniable truth.Brokeback Mountain is a rare, unsettling, jewel of a movie.Go see this Movie!
I have now seen Brokeback twice. The first time I went home not knowing what I thought. I went in expecting a nice love story, and it really isn't nice at all. It shows how awful it was (and in some places still is) to be gay in America. I guess I was sort of mad that they we not happy, and then missed some details in the movie. After seeing it for a second time, I picked up a lot of details and ended up loving the movie. People complain about the "love" scene, and I did at first, but they were just trying to make it realistic. While I personally don't think more than 1% of gay guys jump into sex quite that quick, or in that way, they do do "that."I have talked to LOTS of people who have seen the movie, and while it was not everyone's favorite movie of the year, everyone has liked it.See it before you judge it, and I think chances are you wont feel cheated out of your money.
Usually I am not much of a movie finatic. Particularly since most movies today don't have content, just glamours tricks on film.But I have read numerous feedback about Brokeback Mountain, so I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and the movie is so good, I had to pick up a copy of the story book in which Brokeback Mountain is found.Mind you, though, that content is what many movie viewers don't know about. So if the only movie you watch is action, or flicks, then you probably aren't sophisticated enough to appreciate this film.
Okay, I really don't understand what the big deal is with guys who say that this is a woman's movie. This movie is the combination of romance and spirituality, both are qualities of all human beings, not just for women. In fact, I went to this movie with my book club. There are both men and women in this group, and we voted, unanimously, that this should be the best picture winner.Of course, we all know what Oscar did after that...Another sexist move, but expected considering that men dominated the Oscar board.Oh, and the reviewer who said that this is a girl movie, not guys, and that straight guys should not watch this movie, you might be interested to know that I reported your comment to Amazon as inappropriate. Sexists comments like that should not exist anywhere on this board, if not the world!
I am sure that Brokeback Mountain was a real eye opener for many people.  Never before has a film forced its audience to see the heart wrenching state of those who have taken a separate path in life and the consequences suffered dealing with stringent societal constraints and an established moral code.This film will always be remembered by anyone who viewed it.  It has already become a classic unto itself and will be critically reviewed over and over again in years to come.If I had had a vote at the Oscars, in addition to the three Oscars awarded, I would have given the film, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal top honors with Oscars.  I am heartened that BAFTA awarded Jake best supporting actor in London.I was not satisfied with the "soundtrack" CD nor did I purchase it.  It is my hope that the real sound track will be released in the near future.I would like to think that regardless of the paths people have chosen in living there lives that we are all God's own.
I've seen this movie before.  It was borrowed and lost.  I purchased it to replace my copy. Good Movie. !
beautiful, understated love story. I just saw this and I'm almost overcome with emotion. heartbreaking and tragic, both actors were excellent, especially ledger, a quiet, nuanced, performance. a brave movie, well done ang lee. I have friends who've been gay-bashed, so this hits close to home for me.update: I've read many review here, and agree with most of them. what I don't understand is the reaction of some people, you must know going in that this is a movie about a relationship between two men, why the outrage? why are you offended?  if you are uncomfortable, please stay away.
I went to see "Brokeback Mountain" on the advice of a friend. I didn't know what to expect. Heath Ledger was amystery to me. But ever since childhood days cowboys fascinatedme and I sort of became addicted to westerns, particularlyRandolph Scott. The opening scenes moved slowly and there wasLedger...quiet, mumbling, in a way reminding me of James Deanin "Giant" with that simple presence. Then came the tent scene.Wow!...was I  seeing things? Had the wrong movie get turned onby mistake? No...this was really happening on the screen. Herewere these two rugged macho guys...cowboys up there doing whatmakes men tremble at the thought of doing: making love. I managedto stay in my seat...then came the ride on the stallion, theforeboding sky, the journey to tend sheep but really only Godknew where to. My eyes misted thinking what the cowboy must have felt seeing that butchered sheep. I suddenly thought of lots ofthings, like what the rest of the movie was like, thought of myfriend and why he kept the sex scene a secret, but mostly Ithought of an old admonition I'd heard about how a man isn't supposed to have a romantic interest in another man. Yeah...I'd hoped the movie would show the two cowboys turning intostandard creeps for whom I could have no sympathy for. But I wasnot so lucky, for by the time the movie was over my cup ran overwith empathy for these two. Something touched me and my eyes misted over by film's ending and Ennis sad.I left the theatre in no mood to shop. I decided to dropin on my friend. He was busy developing film, but listened anywayas I asked him why he didn't warn me about you know what. "Causeif I did you wouldn't have gone, am I right?" Yeah...I had toadmit he was right. I am just the type who avoids the strange.Then he said "Now tell me what you liked?" Then I unloaded andtold him the directing reminding me of George Stevens. Themusic breath-taking...the scenery gorgeous. Then, saving my bestfor last, told him of Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack with doe-like eyesthat worked so well for him, making his character easy to read.That look of devotion he gives to Ledger...so convinced me he'dwait around forever! Then there's the amazing Heath, a virtualtreasure trove of talent. The look, the gesture, that walk ofhis, even his grunting...they'd be crazy if they didn't givehim the Oscar. He has all these and he breaks your heart withthem. His scenes at the end were brilliant. He could open up aschool for acting any day. In his quiet moments he does more withless than anyone acting today. My friend smiled and then casuallyasked me if "Brokeback Mt." changed me in any way. I didn't knowwhat to say. Suddenly something hit me, something that had beenlooking at me that I'd not wanted to recognize since I left thetheatre, thinking it would go away."Well?" my friend asked. I said it may sound funny...butI was sure Randolph Scott was looking at me. My friend let out anenormous laugh. Yeah...like he's waiting for something from me.Like what my attitude was towards Ennis and Jack. Would I approveof them riding along the chisolm trail with him? It's dumb, I know, but since they've been through so much misery that maybe...maybe we'd show our hearts are in the right place and allow themto come? I even remembered my childhood toy gun and holster andcowboy hat...one that had puff balls like fringe around the crown. My mom bought me that hat. Yeah, maybe this movie heldobjectionable things in it when examined using the head. Yetsome things and some movies should be looked at with the heartmore than with the head. This movie is one like that.
Unlike what the two recent reviewers say about Brokeback Mountain, society still has a lot of pressure on how a person should live, and behave.Brokeback Mountain is a wakeup call for people to see what the world truly is. Gay bashing has always existed, and still exists. Even today, even when someone is killed, as long as the person is homosexual, the media and police will turn a blind eye against the case (as in the case of Rashawn Brazell, New York)Consider this movie as a cry for our desire of a better world. If society really will happily accept these two characters as couples, why do they need to go behind their wives' backs? Remember, the only relationships where cheating occurs is unsatisfied ones that should be broken off anyways.
If you're someone who likes great movies, then I think you'll like this one. Ang Lee rarely disappoints, and this is no exception.Yes, it's about "gay cowboys", but it's so much more. The movie has no agenda other than telling it's story, which is moving and beautiful. I thought I might be uncomfortable with the subject matter, but I was able to relate, because afterall, emotions are universal, and tha'ts what theis movie is. It' doesn't preach, it just puts everything up there on screen and lets you experience the movie. Ang Lee is the master of subtlety.
I want to respond to a few of the comments by other reviewers.  First, let me say that Brokeback Mountain is a powerful movie and a work of art.  I am a gay man and have seen hundreds of gay movies, including "gay cowboy" movies.  None have moved me as much as this movie.  All the actors, the writing, directing, etc. are phenominal.  Heath Ledger is remarkable.  How a twenty-six year old straight male can have such understanding, compassion and depth of emotion is almost incomprehensible to me.Now to my remarks.  One writer wishes Ennis had spoken more and was unmoved by the shirt scene towards the end.  This scene just blows me away and brings me to tears even after seeing it 5 times.  Ennis doesn't speak much because that is the way Annie Proulx wrote the character.  Ang Lee and the screenwriters are being true to the story.Second, several writers commented that they did not see the reason for the relationship between Jack and Ennis.  This actually is perhaps too subtley revealed in a brief flashback Jack has near the end of the movie when Ennis, as a young man, walks up to him from behind and holds him very tenderly.  To those who have not seen the movie this scene is depicted in a lot of posters and such you may have seen.  This scene is a reference to a few lines in the original story.  Both men came from very emotionally impoverished lives.  We know that Jack was never really loved or emotionally supported by his father. The view of his childroom bedroom reveals a total bareness of emotion, love or beauty in his upbringing.  In the short story it is stated that the memory of this one embrace and all the feeling that came with it, the emotions it freed, twenty years earlier, and not sex, is what kept Jack coming back to Ennis for twenty years of "infrequent high altitude f...ks".  I can understand this completely.  Jack, in that embrace, experiences all the emotional closeness and warmth he never had from any man growing up.  It must be a tremendous release to a man, born gay, but having no understanding of warmth between men.  Jack returns again and again to Ennis because of the power of this early embrace.  Would they make it as a couple if they actually lived together twenty years?  Who knows?  Who cares?  See the movie.
This movie stole my heart, and also helps people realize just how far the gay community has come since that time, Its great to know that my fiance and i do not have to be afraid to be who we are like they were so afraid to be in this movie.  Loved the passion that they had for each other in this movie.I would highly recommend this movie to people who are afraid of their sexuality, and hopefully it will help them except who they are
A hundred years from now, when cinema is being discussed, "Brokeback Mountain" will be loved, degraded, re-evaluated, and argued about. And that is the mark of a truly great film. I am still befuddled that the Oscar voting swayed the best film award of 2005 to "Crash", and even more perplexed by its backhanded honor to Jake Gyllenhaal with a best supporting actor nomination, when clearly, he not only gave an astonishing performance in a leading role, but was impetus behind the entire storyline. I mean, for crying out loud, without Jake/Jack's first sexual overture, or his postcards to Ennis, what would have created the plot? Long before I had even heard about "Brokeback Mountain", I tried to watch "Crash", not once, but twice, and only made it through less than a half-hour. "Crash" is a pretentious, fragmented mess, loaded with pretty movie stars delivering cardboard acting jobs. It disappeared from theatres "molto pronto", fell off the DVD sales market even faster, and despite its windfall, it will soon be forgotten completely. Yes, "Brokeback" was overhyped and overtalked about, but that was because of the AUDIENCE's response to it. Before it opened, the producers worried that they'd never be able to market it, but it was word-of-mouth that pushed the film over the top. You'd think that respecting its enormous, unexpected success might have occurred to the academy, since they've been trying desperately to get people back into the movie houses. Instead, they shot themselves in the foot. While "Crash" rehashed and reheated the old-time Hollywood racial theme, "Brokeback Mountain" opened up a whole new can of beans. And isn't it way past time that maintream media started lifting its opinion of gays out of the baffoonery basement? To the socially unaware, a staggering amount of adolescent suicides are directly relatable to unresolved issues of homosexuality. Why? Largely because young gay people, particulary males, have no role models. Richard Simmons? Isaac Mizrahi? Jack on "Will & Grace"? Yes, Tommy, there are gay men who are not annoying, self-centered clowns. I won't bother mentioning all the well-known actors shamefully hiding in the closet. When will Hollywood start telling the truth about Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Proust, Henry James, Tchaicovsky, Michaelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Walt Whitman, Cole Porter, Christopher Marlowe, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Alexander the Great, Herman Melville, Ismail Merchant, James Ivory, Dag Hammarskjold . . . Hey, how about a movie about some high school kids that instigate a Gay History Week?Whew! Okay, "Brokeback Mountain" is ultimately to be appreciated as a tragic love story. Romeo and Juliet can now back off. Seeing this movie is an emotional watershed, an epiphany. It confirms that art can be life-transforming.The most astonishing thing about "Brokeback Mountain" is the acting by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Even if you viewed this movie with no expectations as to what it was about, and even though it's at least a half-hour before Jack and Ennis become remotely sexual, the instant you see them together, you'll be struck by their chemistry. It leaps off the screen and practically sits in your lap. We see and feel immediately that there is going to be more than a buddy movie unravelling. Truly astounding. Imagine: two men in a love story, giving performances that up to now had only come from the likes of Gable and Lombard, Tracy and Hepburn, Streisand and Redford. Now that's progress! Ledger and Gyllenhaal deserved every accolade they recieved, and then some."Brokeback Mountain" is not a grandiose, cinematic epic. There is no overbearing music playing, there are no incredibly fancy camera shots, the actors are not made up to look like movie star gods. It is a very slow film, as it needs to be. It makes us ask ourselves "How and why do particular people come into our lives? What is at work that randomly throws two combustable souls together?" As I think about Jack and Ennis, haphazardly thrown together by chance, alone on a mountaintop, what are the odds that these two would find exactly what they were looking for in each other? I cannot get out of my mind this phrase: "What God has joined together, let no man put asunder."I love it that there are so many diverse thoughts and feelings about "Brokeback". Several gay men told me they were bored out of their minds, but afterwards, could not stop talking, thinking, or crying about it. Some heterosexual friends said there should have been more love scenes, others thought the utter peacefulness and boyish roughhousing between Ennis and Jack when they were alone together spoke volumes. Many told me they hadn't realized how many "straight-acting" homosexuals they actually knew until they were reminded by Jack and Ennis. The most bizarre comment came from Gene "Time To Retire" Shalit, who described Jack as a sexual predator! Try saying that about Rhett Butler, Gene!!! I myself find it interesting that while Jack initiates, Ennis then takes the reigns, and Jack willingly succumbs to him. Throughout the movie, Jack and Ennis trade "roles", so to speak. As in real life, nothing is a stereotype. It's also fascinating that despite Ennis supposed innocence and naivte, when push comes to shove, he instantly knows exactly how to respond to Jack's advances.The time and place of "Brokeback Mountain" have loaded the film with interesting subtexts. Starting in 1963 and ending in the seventies, we can't help but muse "Is it possible these characters really existed? Is Ennis still alive? Did he ever find Jack in some wonderful hereafter?". As many have stated already, having the story set in today's world would probably just end up like a long, complicated episode of "Queer As Folk". Not having to deal with AIDS, crowded gay dance clubs, gyms, and high fashion, "Brokeback" is able to maintain a beautiful simplicity.One of the most touching realities presented in "Brokeback Mountain" is the importance of holding on to a loved one's possessions, in this case, Ennis' blood-stained shirt that hangs for years in Jack's childhood bedroom, with Jack's shirt on top of it. So much emphasis is placed on the sexual aspects occurring between men, which is a actually a tiny percentage of what homosexuality is really all about. Like Jack and Ennis, anyone can determine to bed a woman, produce children, and successfully live a lie. It is the profound emotional attachment that comes before and after the sexual act that differentiates gay from straight orientation.There is another element in this film that is as universal as its love story, the element of choice, of being true to yourself. Ennis gives in to simple decisions: to be responsible to his children, to his income, to his safety. To Jack, he will only give in to maintaining a status-quo relationship. Could there be no other option, no way to find some middle-ground? He makes an easy choice, and the result is tragic. Ennis begins as a lonely, pent-up man; finds love; changes and grows; and then unwittingly throws it all away, ending up in a lonlier hell than he started in.Something there for all of us.
I was very surprised, saw a portion on cable and decided to buy and look at all of it.  It seems to address forbiden, but factual issue of today, hopefully it will help some of those who are confussed.  I did'nt think it was my type of movie, it was beautifull done.
I will start by saying Ang Lee's directing is another subject, as it is one of the most stunningly filmed movies I have ever seen. I don't believe that making this movie was brave, as someone has also said before. You don't have to be brave to tell a story you know is very good, fictional or not. I do believe, however, that one is brave in watching it. You don't have to be gay or straight to have curiosity about the movie, and I think either side would have their preconcieved ideas disappointed. It is also, in my opinion, one of the most terrifying movies I have seen in my entire life, aside from the first time I saw (the original) "The Omen." If you have ever loved someone in your life, or let a feeling pass by without its communication - you will know what I mean by this. By the end of this movie, every one of those moments will come heaping down upon you, and you will understand the magic of the story. Watch this movie, and you will find yourself in one of the characters. Watch it and it will tell you something about yourself. The real story is about the chances we've taken or lost to find real, unspeakably pure happiness.It is a love story, but this time it is not impossible. *That* is terrifying.
This movie is amazing for a couple.  One, it breaks the barrier of the manly cowboy stereotype.  Two, it is a good story, and makes you feel all emotions possible.
I just saw this movie today with my sister and I can't believe I waited so long to see it.What can be said about this movie, that hasn't already been said? Two men, Jack and Ennis fall in love with each other one summer while working together on Brokeback Mountain, thus beginning a long, wonderful, yet painful affair.All I have to say is if you haven't seen this movie yet, please go see it. You won't regret it! And to the woman who was making stupid complaints in the seat behind me at the theatre, "If you didn't like the movie, why didn't you just leave and let the others watch the movie in peace?"
Regarding Jacob Cartwright's comment about the sountrack on the DVD, well maybe its your television or DVD player, I have a Panasonic 32" widescreen, am using the higest quality cables available and I can assure you the sound on the DVD is perfect, actually friends thought I had a sub woofer connected, am using just the stock speakers, try better cables from your DVD player.
I was extraordinarily disappointed at the failure of nerve displayed by AMPAS at the Oscar's Ceremony to give so many Oscars to such less deserving "winners."  Brokeback Mountain deals with so many of life's profound mysteries on so many different levels it is hard to summarize it in a short review.  Heath Ledger, whose creativity in bringing Ennis del Mar to life monumentally surpasses the achievement of any other actor in 2005, was upstaged by an actor who was recognized merely for his ability to impersonate.  At least BAFTA recognized Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance as Jack Twist.  "Best Picture" Crash deals with issues of racism.  Would racism be an issue if everyone were treated equally regardless of race? Gender?  No one chooses to be born different from everybody else.  No one chooses to be born disadvantaged, handicapped, or gay.  Regardless of what we are born with, we make of life what we can and we play the cards we are dealt. The tragedy of life is that some of us play our cards better than others and clearly some of us are dealt better hands than others.  Thats what makes Brokeback Mountain timeless - Ennis and Jack had no choice in who they were, who they loved or when and how they discovered they were different and this movie reflects that poignantly, beautifully, tenderly and with a quiet honest respect for its subject.  Here in 2005 we think we have more choices, but clearly the reaction to this movie indicates many people are still as crippled emotionally today as people were in 1963.  Growth comes slowly and emotional growth is fraught with pain.  All of us can look back at choices made and regretted.  Annie Proulx said she wrote her short story about homophobia.  She did, but like all great art it was predicated on an underlying truth: love is a force of nature.  Ang Lee, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry and everyone who worked on this movie transformed a New Yorker short story into one of the centuries' epic morality tales.  It is not a morality tale for red or blue states, heterosexuals or homosexuals; it is not a morality tale of what is right or wrong - its moral is love or die, and the corollary to that moral is God gives you no choice in whom you love because we are commanded to love everyone as yourself.  If we all did that this movie would never have been made.  It is worth seeing over and over and over again.  This movie will be on the 100 best list for centuries.
Having failed to see this film for 3 1/2 years, I am amazed - both by the powerful content and the stunning delivery.The moving and unresolved romance between Ennis and Jack runs like a tumor through the life and family of each man, bringing into sharp focus the accumulating destruction of double lives and the cultural requirements that fertilize them, even in cases where the hidden life is mostly un-materialized.Astoundingly experiential, the film depicts a romance without any labels/identifications/etc often found in coverage of gender and sexuality. My perception is that both Ennis and Jack "are" bisexual, but find wide disagreement on this question with various critics claiming they are straight, bisexual or gay. Similarly, we experience the circumstances of Jack's death as a feared uncertainty rather than something we can attach a label to ("accident", "hate crime", etc). This stylistic approach reinforces the power of the story by letting us feel the excruciating uncertainty of a life that is loved but cannot be shared.Otherwise, the natural scenery is unbelievable, beautiful mountains, animals, rivers, men (!), etc.Watch this film!
The biggest difference between Western Movies and Eastern Movies is probably that, while Eastern Movies shows turn of events, conflicts, and survival by clinging to the soul, Western Movie are mostly just Laughs, Anger, Fear, or Tears. Rarely are messages so woven into the movie that it cannot be understood, only felt. So I was quite surprised when I saw two major Western Movie stars acting out a movie that is so delicate. This movie, obviously, moved my very spirit, but I was more surprised to find that the western society is able to produce a movie with such degrees of beauty. Perhaps there are still hopes for the movie industry after all.
I'm sure you know by now what the premise of the movie is about.  Looking beyond the fact that this is a story about two cowboys that fall in love is a feat within itself.My male (straight) friend watched this with me, and he was in tears once the credits rolled.  Love is universal and equally beautiful no matter the circumstances.It really goes to the core of what it must be like to outwardly deny that love that you want the world to see.Makes you think.

All things are said about this wonderful and haunting film. I made me stay up all night after the first view and I had to see it again the next day. I funny and logic to see the reviews spreading in utter two sides: totally not or totally perfect. Well, I logic in a sence it presents two kinds of people: the ones who feel and have a heart, the ones who do not. Simply!~For the ones who feel, who felt pain and suffering, who is in touch with her/his feelings, go see this film. It will change your life.
Take the west, its majestic views and quiet nights.  Its hills and mountains and rivers and valleys.  A place that does not change much.  A frontier that often more than not, sees the beauty of nature far more than the ugliness man can sometimes bring to it.Now take that setting, and put man there.  Then in the center put two individuals who are proof as gods creatures, all are created equal, although they will never be treated that way by fellow man.The evil starts to slip in.  It starts to envelope the goodness of the heart and the heart says "I must hide".  The mind says "I must turn away".  And the man at the mike says "whoaaaah!!"  Gotcha, you see the real ignorance behind this movie is not the movie, or the people who were disappointed with it.  Its the people who are trolling here voting negative to every single person who has something to say about the movie that isn't crooning over it like its the next Casablanca of film.  Real prejudice and ignorance lies within, within people who are not willing to accept all gods creatures for who they are.  That is evident on this movies reviews.  People come on here and give it four stars and list a couple of minor faults and get 112 negatives to 23 positives?  That is messed up.  However, perfect in every way, for it shows that even the people who think they are open minded are in fact the ignorant ones.  Why not listen with an open mind?  You tell people to watch the movie with an open mind but then chastise anyone who disagrees with you deeming it a five star diva meant for the hall of fame.  I give the moviefive stars, but I know that still wont stop whoever is out there trolling to negate it into never never land because I defend people who are honstley being constructive and intelligent in their crticism of this film.  These people are not the ones who took a tire iron to Jacks face, so stop treating them like they are, otherwise you are the one with the iron in your hand, on the side of the road.  My regards, Lewis
I wasn't sure about this movie-a couple of friends said it sucked. But I went ahead and watched it for myself. And was completely amazed at how great this film is. Forget the whole "gay cowboy" thing and just watch good cinema!
I really didn't want to go see this movie because I knew it was going to make me cringe.  And I was right, it did.  But I also liked it a lot more than I expected I would.  The scenery, music, editing and acting come together to produce a beautiful, thoughtful and tragic story that has a lot to say about the nature of human relationships and what we need and value in them.  Ang Lee definitely deserved the directing oscar, as this could have been detestable if not wholly laughable.  Instead what we have in "Brokeback Mountain" is nothing short of a melancholy masterpiece.
This is story telling at its best. I give my heartfelt thanks to the entire cast, crew, writers, producers and director for making such a sublimely beautiful story. This movie depicts the tortured life of two poor, uneducated guys who just happened to be gay growing up in the deeply homophobic heartland (an oxymoron if I've ever heard one). Their story is painful to watch and makes you wonder, if in a different world, they would have lived long fulfilled happy lives.  But ignorance is alive and well in the good ol' USA guaranteeing many more years of tragic stories like this one for the unfortunate souls deemed unworthy of the righteous right.  Hopefully the laws of physics will keep humanity from reaching distant worlds for thousands of years to come.  The idiotic way we treat each other and our own planet is proof enough that we don't deserve such power and knowledge. More importantly however, alien species wouldn't deserve our hatred, bigotry and man-made religious intolerance!  Brokeback Mountain, though not intended, is a testament to human ignorance and intolerance!  But its also a wake up call to an emotionally psychotic society that still churns out young men with a deep hatred and fear of the emotion Brokeback brings to life with such clarity.  The question so many have not faced is "What are you so afraid of and why?"  This movie is a timely and important film to be seen by all.
SPOILER ALERT"Brokeback Mountain" is one of the most affecting, beautiful movies I've ever seen. It's beyond Western, it's beyond romance, it's beyond gay cinema, although it has elements of all of these things. It's simply great cinema. Every aesthetic and technical detail is superb, making the elegiac pace not just bearable but enjoyable. Jake Gyllenhaal excels as Jack Twist; his performance only suffers by comparison to Heath Ledger's anguished genius as Ennis Del Mar (which means, fittingly, "island in the sea"). Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway do fine work as Ennis and Jack's wives respectively."Brokeback Mountain"'s tragedy is specific to its time, place and characters. It is about the oppression and marginalization of gay men in small-town America in the early 1960s. In that time and place, no gay person would ever dare to "come out." Jack at least understands who he is. The viewer never doubts that Jack is a closeted gay man. Although he marries and has a child (as did many gay men in that era, including members of my family), during his and Ennis's many lengthy separations, Jack picks up gay prostitutes in Mexico and reaches out to another man to determine if he too might be gay. It's strongly hinted that Jack is killed because he dares to follow his true nature. Jack's tragedy is that he is a gay man in the wrong place and time.Ennis is the character who is "locked down" in a more universal way and therefore brings the film to its more universal tragedy. Ennis liked school but was unable to graduate due to dire family circumstances. He has an indelible childhood memory of seeing a rancher suspected of homosexuality tortured and killed and the fear never leaves him. Although Jack suggests that he and Ennis leave and go to a big city or start a ranch together somewhere, Ennis is trapped by his limitations, his fears,  other people's expectations, and his own expectations. He stays in his bleak home town, marries his high school girlfriend, and has two daughters, stuck forever in material and emotional poverty. Unlike Jack, there is no suggestion that Ennis is attracted to any man other than Jack. In fact, after his divorce, Ennis dates another woman, but things don't work because he's so shut down emotionally. Whatever Ennis's clinical sexual orientation may be, Jack is the love of Ennis's life, as we see from the exquisite scene at the end of the movie where Ennis, in his lonely trailer, cries over his and the now-dead Jacks' shirts, together on the same hanger, and Willie Nelson's "He Was a Friend of Mine" plays over the closing credits. Ennis's is the tragedy of the person or any race or sexual orientation at any time in history whose combination of life circumstances and personality prevent him or her from living an authentic and rewarding life."Brokeback Mountain" is that rare treasure of a movie that engages you emotionally, makes you think, and is at the artistic pinnacle of the filmmakers' art and craft. Of course it did not win the Best Picture Academy Award. That distinction went to the superficial "Crash." No matter. People will be watching and weeping over "Brokeback Mountain" in future decades, long past the time when love is no longer divided into gay and straight but is simply love, while "Crash" becomes an obscure curiosity.
See it.  You'll find something in every viewing that you missed the last time.Ang Lee's eye for panoramic beauty is untouched by any other director.  This film continues to take award after award with no end in sight which sadly means it will be a while yet before this film comes to DVD.
It is not for youngsters in my opinion. It shows the many sides and emotions involved in a love relationships between 2 men, as well as the young ladies they end up marrying and how it effects all the people involved. Parents, children, spouses....and each other employment.  If you watch this and feel nothing I fear that you likely are heartless or dead.
I enjoyed this movie about to cowboys who become best freinds over time while ranching and sharing quality time until one of them passes away.
A must see!
Beautiful movie. It's the real world, so let's accept the subject matter. Great acting, scenery and directing.
I won't take up alot of space raving about the film. So many others have done that pretty well here. I'll just say that the film captures the loneliness of Wyoming perfectly then perfectly transposes it to the lives of the characters.  Ang Lee just has to win the academy award for this one thing alone. Masterpeice is not too strong a word.The one point that the film makes, and I think has been lost in all the "gay hoopla", is the collateral damage in the lives of the people forced to live as someone they are not. Look at the families of the two lead characters.  Both suffered immeasurably because of the lie their husbands/fathers were forced to live. I would tell the religious right and anyone who wants gay people to fake their lives by pretending to be straight to consider the others in the equation. Even if you can never understand homosexuality yourself have some feelings for the people who will spend their lives confused and hurt, perhaps never understanding why their spouse/father is so emotionally unavailable to them.Days after seeing this film it still resonates with me.  Go see this film.
This is one of the most beautiful and heart-breaking love stories I have ever watched.  It haunted my mind for days after seeing it - really touching and not to be missed.
If like myself, you heard all of the hoopla and jokes pointed at this movie, (not the least of which, was the line from Jack to Ennis, "I wish I knew how to quit you") avoiding seeing it might have seemed like a good decision.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is not the "Gay Cowboy" movie, but a devastatingly beautiful story about love between two men.  The intimate scenes are tastefully filmed and poignant.  For ranch hand Ennis Delmar, being gay is beyond his scope of understanding in 1963 Wyoming.  While he and the only slightly more aware, Jack Twist find themselves herding sheep together for a summer job in Wyoming, the truly unexpected happens.  They become friends and suddenly much more.  While both men go on to try and live the conventional married with children lifestyle with women, meeting up with each other again four years later only proves to each other that theirs, is the real love.  For nearly twenty years they meet a few times a year in the safe confines of Brokeback Mountain.  The marriages of both men deteriorate under the strain of an all consuming love that has to be kept a secret from the world, at least as far as Ennis is concerned.  The viewer is made painfully aware of the suffering due to separation and longing, of lifelong love and passion.  All of this is done with stellar performances by Ledger and Gyllenhall, who can say more with a look than any words might convey.  Ang Lee directs with a sensitive but no holds barred approach.  The cinematography is so good as to give this movie an epic feel.  The windy, Wyoming plains pound home the feelings of loneliness and desolation this movie evokes. The bottom line is, love is love.  One walks away from this movie profoundly moved.  An interesting little twist near the end shows Ennis viewing the contents of Jack's closet.  This is when love and heartbreak transcends any type of sexual orientation to become the language we all know and speak.  A must see movie, maybe twice!
First of all, can I just say, "MY GOD" I haven't seen such a brilliantly made movie since "MILLION DOLLAR BABY", even though I do think Brokeback Mountain does surpass Million Dollar Baby, with regards to better acting and just an all around, a better movie. Even though Clint Eastwood is "THE MAN"! The title of my review expresses exactly how I was feeling when I left the theater.This is the tragic love story of two cowboys who fall in love while in the mountains of Brokeback. With the first love scene, it comes of as an unreasoning or an extravagant passion or attraction, which can be defined as INFATUATION. In the movie, we later on realize that, it's not infatuation at all, but something that goes much deeper. Something many of us don't like to say unless we truly meant it, something we call.... LOVE. Regardless of the fact that it is a love between two men, we as humans should understand because love is a universal emotion which everyone, straight or not, can understand and feel. Brokeback Mountain depicts every emotion we as humans feel; Love...sadness...fear...and anger.I was blown away by the performances of all the cast members including Anne Hathaway, which many people basically forgot was in the movie. Even though I do agree with her not being nominated for an Oscar because her performance was the weakest. Honestly, as hard as it is to say, because Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite actor EVER and probably one of the most underrated,(Even though people are starting to catch on to him now) although he's been great since DONNIE DARKO. Heath Ledger's performance was stronger and more powerful than Jake's. I feel as though if anyone should've won an Oscar, he should.(Damn u, Capote!). His performance was one of the best performances to ever not win an Oscar in the history of the academy awards. Although these are strong words, they are true. I have never seen Heath act with so much heart and, passion and take on a character who isn't even an embody that fictional character like he did in Brokeback Mountain. Unlike the other actors who were nominated, who had someone who they could mirror and were trying to portray which, is still great. But to become someone who doesn't even exist with such passion and raw talent it would've seemed as though there were really an Ennis del Mar!Now on to Jake and Michelle. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was incredible as Jack Twist in Brokeback Mountain. But everyone should remember that, just because your not crying in every scene, fighting a cause, or even screaming at people in a dramatic and emotional way, doesn't mean you can't create a powerful performance. Which is exactly what Jake did, he was subtle with a lot of his expressions and feelings, and wasn't aggressive in several scenes. For the main part, Jake was very subtle, to portray a character that was in love with another man, not by choice.Best said in this line,"I anit no queer," said Ennis, Jack replies,"me neither." His facial expressions and body language are priceless in the film, and those are attributes which not everyone possess. During these times an actor's real talent is shown, because its not always about how dramatic you can be.Michelle Williams performance is heartbreaking to watch. She, like Heath, really did a '180'(degree)in terms of the fact that I wasn't really a huge fan of their acting, and they've just done wonders in this film. We get to see her go through the horrible experience of her having to come to terms with the fact that her husband is having an affair, and to make matters worse, with the possibility that he could be gay; with his affair having to be with another man. Also, how every time he goes away to fish with his friend, they are together in more than one way. Michelle's breakdown in the movie was nothing short of incredible and moving. She may not have won the Oscar, but she surely deserved it. But I guess that it all depends on the opinion of the viewers/critics. And finally Ang Lee; Wow. No words can describe how thankful I am to him for making this movie and having the courage to carry on even with all the obstacles he had to face trying to make the movie. Thank you for your genius idea because this movie could've easily been a disaster. Even though Brokeback was snubbed for best picture, they had to give it to you Ang because your directing was nothing short of brilliant.... Thank You with the dearest of appreciation.Going to the movie, I was just expecting a great movie. But now thinking back, this was more than just a great movie. It was one of a kind, and probably will remain that way. I felt, basically, every emotion that Heath , Jake , Michelle , and even Anne felt. This may be a movie about tragedies, but the biggest tragedy was the Oscars showing there true colors; giving the best picture award to a movie that in its own right, was incredible but nowhere near on the same level, and as brilliantly made as Brokeback Mountain. This movie tears at your heart for 2 hrs and 15 mins, and with the way I, and probably many others, felt for many days to come.
I am sure that all of you have already read the many reviews about this movie. So instead of giving out spoilers, I just want to say how much of a breakthroughs this movie is to the movie industryAmericans have always had a reputation for being simple minded. Part of the reason is their tendency to judge something by its cover rather than what it truly is. So many people focus their attention on action movies that they never stop to appreciate the beauty of the plot.Brokeback Mountain has set a new standard to the film industry. It shows people that we are no longer brainless robots that believe in propaganda, but intelligent beings who have the mind to appreciate beauty and stories. I would give this movie a 10 star, but there is no such function.
I won't tell the story, which you already know, and I won't indulge in fancyadjectives.  Simply said, this film will last.  Its reputation will not only stay atthis elevation--it will rise.Well, a few adjectives:  it is spare.  It is honest.  It is devastating.  It is true.It is (so far) unique--one of a kind.The people who made this $14 million dollar film (which has grossed $82 milliondomestically and $150 million in theaters alone, with double that to come onDVD, are heroes.  The director, the actors and actressses, the writers--they allworked for relatively little money by Hollywood standards, and they managed tomake this staggeringly good film.  Again, they are heroes.
This is the best love story I have ever seen. Ang Lee has a knack for telling tragic love stories, and this is his best work. It's just beautiful. I've watched it 4 times since I've bought the DVD. After watching all of the movies that were nominated for the Best Picture, this one is by far the best.
I took some homophobic friends to see this film today and watched as they felt guilty to mock it afterwards. The combination of crumbling families and discrimination forces the audience to mourn the pain of the characters, especially Heather Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams.This is a perfect example of how individuals weigh the importance of social acceptance with the overwhelming power of love. The realistic display of these characters stumbling through their lives, unsure of which path to choose, gives everyone who sees the film a glimpse of what it's like to conceal their real selves from loved ones and society at large.Ang Lee did an amazing job sculpting so much pain into a work of art.
I hardly know where to begin.  Words are useless, it seems, in describing this story.  There ARE none to explain the gut-wrenching feelings in my heart.  I am a 67 year old grandma and I have NEVER felt like this about any other movie.  Brokeback sits in my heart...like NOTHING else ever has.  I saw this movie three weeks ago and I can't get it out of my mind.  I've tried...believe me.  It's brought forth the lost loves in my life...the pain and torture I've felt and the warmth I feel when reminiscing.  Every emotion I've ever felt has been SLAMMED back into my heart and soul.  Ennis...was ME!!  'Words always escaped me...I was always unable to voice my thoughts and feelings. Love would slip through my fingers because of my inability to hold on....FEAR...RAGE...LOVE...and sadness.  Heath Ledger has accomplished, in this movie, what no one ever has before.  He conveyed all these emotions without the inane chatter that most actors depend upon.  And Jack...what can I say about Jack?  He was all my loves...wrapped into one.  Loving, caring, open, honest, wanting but not 'getting'.  Broken hearted and SOOO hurt by Ennis' inability to open up to him.  It matters NOT that Ennis and Jack were men.  What matters is...the LOVE between two human beings.  Everlasting and true!!  I've never been so effected by a movie...EVER.  It will sit in my heart forever.  Thank you Ang Lee..Heath...Jack..and all the others for bringing this forth.
Boy Oh Boy, what a joy. i have only seen this film very very recently and you have no idea what an impact it has had on me. Never before have  I seen two characters protrayed on the screen which have touched me in such a meaningful and extraordinary way. I cried and cried as their love affair fell apart from the 1963 Brokeback meeting right through to their final separation.This was a stunning love affair, between two people, which moved from the physical and sexual side onto a higher and more meanigful plain in the end. Sadly it took death to move it into this realm, a fact that all of us seem to forget, and with death it is to late to act.I fell in love with Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar right from the start of this story and I can only take my hat off to the fine acting, wonderful script, and fantastic music.It made me question myself and question my life. Am I Jack or Ennis, I dont know, but I might just Twist Again and play my hand a little differently in the future as we wont be coming back this way again.
For such an intensely spare film, I would like to spend only the necessary words: "Brokeback Mountain" is a great virile love story, beautifully rugged and limpid, destined to become a classic.
First class script, Master Directing, Fantastic Actors/Actresses, What more can you ask for?Brokeback Mountain is a love story that will truly change who you are, and how you view the world. This is a move you have to see. Pick up a copy, and add it to your collection. It's worth it!
very good movie. this is a must have. it was a litte drawn out.
This movie is heartbreakingly romantic, and desperately tragic.  Of course, 50 years ago movies like this were not even imaginable.  However, 50 years ago, popular films tended to be racist and sexist.  The fact that movies like this are drawing an average of 4.5 stars (out of 5) from over 750 reviewers is a definately positive sign - proof that we, the human race, are growing more open minded over time.  50 years ago - this movie would probably never even have made it into theaters.
This was a wonderful love story!! It will have you crying by the end. Well-acted and beautiful cinematography and music. My favorite movie of all time.
Amazingly, you don't have to be gay to appreciate the movie. None of the actors, nor the diector are gay. As An Lee revealed in a interview, he just wanted to protray love in its purest form, without intention, calculation, procreation, or recreation. Don't we all wish, deep in our heart, that we can at least find a true love, even just for a brief movement? The movie makes us think what are important in our short lives. That is why this movie is a success, no matter what the box office indicates. highly recommende!
To miss out on seeing "Brokeback Mountain" is to miss out on the most brilliantly-made miracle of a movie ever made.  It is a story that every person on earth can relate to - and will feel a kinship with.The story is so real, you will relate to it immediately, no matter who you are.  We have all known these characters, and as a result, we know that what we are seeing is real.  What we are seeing is actually every day life - things in OUR OWN world - which is why the tragedy of the story has such a tremendous impact upon everyone who sees it.  The fact that Jack & Ennis are cowboys is inconsequential; this story takes place with different characters across the globe, in Wyoming, in Kenya, in Nepal, in Poland, in Uruguay...I recommend that you see this film at LEAST twice.  Even if you do not blink throughout the movie, you will miss things if you only see it once.  Ang Lee has packed so many details into every frame that it is impossible to pick up on everyone in one viewing.Books and doctoral dissertations will be written about this film.  There is THAT MUCH brilliance put into it.  The comparisons to Homer's Aeneid and to Plato's Banquet, the yin and yang of Ennis driving across the mountainous expanse in one direction at the beginning of the film and then riding in the other direction at the end, the meaning of the color blue in the film, the astonishing camera-work in the final scene between Jack and Ennis, the stunning scene in which Ennis discovers the shirts in Jack's bedroom, and so much more will be written about and studied for decades to come."Brokeback" is a must-see also for at least 7 of the most brilliant acting performances ever put on film.  Heath Ledger's career and life will be transformed forever by the unforgettable brilliance of his portrayal of Ennis.  Even author Annie Proulx has indicated that Ledger understoof Ennis better than she did, and she created the character!  Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams also moved into the Big Leagues of Acting with their brilliant performances, which will delight and haunt you. Anne Hathaway is superb as the beautiful gal who becomes more blonde and stilted with every year of her loveless marriage.  The actors who play Jack's parents will leave you stunned with the perfection of their brief yet terrifying look into the world of the Twist family, and Linda Cardellini is extraordinary in her role.The film is very true to the story.  I highly recommend that you read the story before seeing the film.  It will greatly enhance your understanding of what takes place.Everyone who sees "Brokeback Mountain" is haunted by it for days.  Prepare for an unforgettable experience.  You will be a better person for it.
Its open, unforced depiction of love between two men made Brokeback an instant cultural touchstone, for both good and bad, as it was tagged derisively as the &#34;gay cowboy movie,&#34; but also heralded as a breakthrough for mainstream cinema
I was not planning on buying Brokeback Mountain, but it was offered as part of a package deal with the new Walter Mercado DVD (which I knew my Girlfriend wanted), so I bought both.  Being a typical Latin Macho Guy, I had pre-conceived notions as it relates to this film, but it turned out to be a well done movie.
As I type these words, Brokeback Mountain just won four Golden Globe awards including Best Drama. It's no surprise to a lot of people, even though the film itself was every bit a surprise.Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), both 19 years old, are two poor ranch hands from Riverton, Wyoming. They meet one summer while seeking jobs, and Joe Aguirre (Quaid) hires them to herd sheep up in Brokeback Mountain.Ennis is a taciturn, reserved and shy man. Jack is a charmer, a dreamer, a risk-taker. Their difficult childhoods and shared interests quickly secure a bond between them. Then one cold night, their budding friendship turns into something else: a drunken, violent sexual encounter. The next day, neither of them speaks of the incident, until Ennis tells Jack, "What happened was a one shot deal. I ain't queer." Jack replies, "Me neither."When the summer is over, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways. Ennis marries his sweetheart Elma (Williams) and they raise two daughters. Jack marries wealthy girl Lureen (Hathaway) and has a son. Everything is normal until, after four long years, Ennis receives a postcard from Jack. Something deep inside stirs up a hornet's nest. Their reunion becomes the beginning of a 20-year secret affair. Brokeback Mountain becomes their refuge from the world to which they don't belong.Ledger (Casanova) is extraordinary with his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar, a man who has few words in his vocabulary, a man so repressed that he doesn't know how to express himself or go for what he wants. Ledger reveals so much about his characters, often without saying a word. His mannerism and facial expression speak volume. He's transformed himself realistically into a man that is so unlike the actor himself, who has mostly been known for his fluffy, light performances in the past. In contrast, Gyllenhaal (Proof) has the more lively role. His Jack Twist is the opposite of Ennis in almost every way. Jack's longing for the man he loves is evident in Gyllenhaal's stellar performance. The men also share immense chemistry together. You believe they're real. You believe their feelings for each other are real.While one can argue that it's a character study of two men and their relationship, the women in the story add an immense appeal to the film. Williams (The Station Agent) is amazing with her heartbreaking performance as Ennis's long-suffering wife Alma. When she witnesses something about her husband that she doesn't fully understand, her reaction is incredibly real and painful to watch. Hathaway (Havoc) has a relatively minor role as Jack's indifferent wife Lureen. But her final scene is mesmerizing - Hathaway has matured into a fine actress.Brokeback Mountain unfolds slowly and, under the direction of Lee (Hulk), the pacing is deliberate and leisurely. At more than two hours, the film feels slow sometimes, but it is far from being boring. While the plot is simplistic, the acting is exceptional and there is so much going on at the thematic and emotional levels that one can't help but feel spellbound by the story.The script by awarding-winning writers McMurtry (Terms of Endearment) and Ossana (Dead Man's Walk) expands Proulx's short story into a languid character study that holds on to your heart and doesn't let go. The dialogue is real and to the point - nothing too poetic or out of character. Mostly episodic, there are many fine moments in the film that are emotionally raw and powerful. The ending will haunt you.Lee's direction is masterful, and it clearly demonstrates his versatility as a director. It's even more impressive when you consider Lee's heritage as a Chinese immigrant, and how he so deftly captures Americana in Brokeback Mountains. The cinematography by Rodgrigo Prieto (21 Grams) is breathtaking. The editing is crisp. Gustavo Santaolalla's (Motorcycle Diaries) score is subdue but poignant.Some say this is a "gay cowboy" movie. I say this is a story about love and betrayal and life. Homosexuality is only part of it - the heterosexual aspects of the story are just as strong. If you have ever loved and lost before, you will feel the impact of this story. The film is like fine wine - it delicately lingers on your palate and seeps into your vein. Brokeback Mountain is destined to become an American classic.
the movie is absolutley amazing everytime i think about it i start to cry i mean i wanted those 2 together so bad but of course they never got together it was and amazing movie though and i loved it its one of my favorites and i encourage evryone to try because u will love it and it will make u cry but im pretty sure it will go down in history as one of the greatest and heart breaking love storys ever told!!
Brokeback Mountain is a more than a film, certainly much more than a "gay film".  It is one of the saddest and most profound emotional experiences that you will ever encounter in a movie theatre.  The tragic love story between two soulmates is brilliantly realized by Ang Lee, and the performances are flawless.  Both Jake and Heath are remarkable.  Everything blends beautifully in this powerful story----the script, the direction, the cinematograhy, the scoring, and the performances of the entire cast.  The painful story of these two men caught in circumstances they cannot control, and the resulting tragedy is like nothing else I've seen in recent years.
I traveled by train for an hour to see this film in NYC because it wasn't playing anywhere on Long Island.  It was worth it.  The movie scenery alone was worth the trip.  I haven't seen a mountain that beautiful since Julie Andrews sang to the hills in Austria...Folks, I loved the movie, but I am sick to death of hearing people assure the homophobic public that this "really isn't a gay love story."  The hell it ain't.  That's exactly what it is.  The movie portrays that love to be as genuine, as special, and as fulfilling as the love between straight people; a portrayal long overdue.  We also read from many, that it portrays love that cuts across gender lines.  OK.  But let's not shy away from identifying the love being portrayed.  It is a love story between two gay men (even if they can't identify themselves as gay).  It is not a gay-cowboy movie..  they herded sheep for one summer of the 20 years spanning the film.  Just two men who loved each other more than their wives,,, more than anyone else..At the end of the film I felt depressed.  On the ride back to Long Island, I wondered why a movie was affecting me that way.  I mean, it was sad how it ended, but why was I so personally affected by it?  And I think the the lost opportunities portrayed in the film represent the lost opportunities so many of us who are gay have suffered due to homophobia.  Maybe not just romance, but opportunities that were denied to us because of the prejudice, and how tragic that has been.It was a great movie all around.
I know this subject has been brought up again and again, still, after viewing Brokeback Mountain, I still cannot understand why this movie lost over Crash. Sure, the simple minded would be bored by this movie since nothing about this movie suggest a Pop or Rock nature that young people today seem to degrade themselves to. Still, this movie shows true emotion, master craftmanship, and dedication which Crash, though well intentioned, cannot match! Regardless of Oscar's decision, this movie probably invoked the most amount of support out of all the movies within the last decade, and if times were different, this movie would definitely win the Best Pictures of the year.
1963 Wyoming range provides a quaint and ultimately charming setting for the spirited romance between Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). These two cowboys fall in love with each other on a sheep herding job.The plot of the film though, is their carrying on the relationship in secret. The two men must do this because of whom they are and the times in which they live in. Specifically, they are after the magic of their first summer together--something readily transcending labels, categories, and generations.Director Ang Lee did a tremendous job with the movie, based upon E. Annie Proulx's short story. Credit also goes to Dianna Ossana and Larry McMurty for a great screenplay. I've unfortunately seen enough movies to know that great adaptations are the exception rather than the rule. In addition to it being set in the early 1960's there actually is the feel. It wasn't just a case of somebody claiming their film was set in the 1960's with obviously current props.I am really impressed with the people who were involved with this film. In spite of the meterosexualization of society, heterosexual American men are still squeamish about being involved with anything related to gay sex. This heterosexual woman joins Madonna in commending Ledger and Gyllenhaal both for their decision to read for the film. I honestly do find it shocking that these hang-ups remain in 2005.Some films you have to guess why they have received awards and award nominations. However, Brokeback Mountain is one of the titles where audiences will instantly know why it won or was nominated for (among the countless honors) National Board of Review Top 10 Films, Director of the Year, Los Angeles Film Critics Association Best Picture, Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture, and Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Director, Best Actor Motion Picture Drama, and Best Supporting Actress.
Although this movie is a few years old, I only actually saw it for the first time recently. I fell in love with the movie immediately. It would be the best movie I have ever seen. Great work from Ang Lee. This movie is about forbidden love between two men. Ledger was fantastic as "Innes" and Gyllenhaal was fabulous as "Jack". It so touched my heart I felt like standing in the middle of the road with a big sign saying : "Watch Brokeback Mountain". Michelle Williams, who plays Innes's wife was truly great at her role. Anne Hatheway also made a great impact on me. It is a film with 4 fantastic actors, sad yet romantic. For those who are struggling with coming out as being "Gay", I do reccommend this movie. It demonstartes the consequences of not following your heart, but rather what society expects of you. If you find sad movies too much to handle, then avoid this because I needed a full box of tissues nearby. It is film that will stay in my heart for ever.Rog - Australia
Wonderfully written narrative. A devastating love story steeped in socio-historical truth. What a terrible time to be an American in love!
For someone who reads review more than writing them, it is very rare for me to want to write reviews at all. Even with a movie that I absolutely loved such as Broke Back Mountain, I really did not feel the motivation to write a review until after I see how many propaganda driven, lack of depth, shallow idiots wrote reviews for this movie, just so they can accomplish what politicians and church activist want ever since this movie received the recognitions and nominations they deserve.Broke back Mountain portrayed the universal truth about love, that "Love Is Deepest When It Is Most Difficult." The story starts off with two cowboys, both in desperate situations financially; both came from a less than perfect background. Then, they work in jobs without any support from their employers, and the only people that can comfort them are themselves. Anyone in this situation would fall in love, but their love extends way beyond that. Through the time they spend on Broke Back Mountain, characteristics that these two are destined lovers began to play out. For example, Jack's energetic spirit is the kind of energy needed to awake the comfort within Ennis, while Ennis's calm but firm spirit is the kind of caring nature Jack needs. They both share the same values, same thoughts, and if this were a girl-boy movie, as all the third rated movies Hollywood have made perhaps too much of due to a lack of extraordinary writer and director as talented as Annie Proulx and Ang Lee, then it would be easy to see that these two are suppose to be lovers. But why should the situation be any different when it comes to Two Men? It isn't any different, and finally, on a cold night on Broke Back Mountain, the two started the love that was already meant to happen.Deep inside Jack and Ennis, and perhaps every viewer of Broke Back Mountain, there is a realization that Jack and Ennis are meant to be together, instead of going seperately to wives because of the propaganda they are surrounded with. Yet, that is exactly what broke Jack and Ennis apart: Propaganda. These men would have been extraordinary together, but the propaganda that men should be with women force them into separate lives, and when Jack wants to escape this Propaganda, he is killed. Ennis lived on his own from that point on, and carried on this love for the rest of his life.Now ask yourself, are you viewing the core of this movie? Or are you judging this movie by the surface which, due to the same propaganda that kept Jack and Ennis apart, is a love that is not suppose to happen. All of you who think very lowly of this movie did it because you claim that these men are not in love. Yet you would say that the other Hollywood flicks, which is filled with people who just have sex on each other when they meet, and dump each others the next day, is true love. Some of you even claimed that this book portrayed that [...] life is miserable, and this movie is about two miserable men seeking each other for sexual release. You are right, these men are miserable, but how can they not be when people like you are pressuring propaganda on them? Stop, and take the gender issue away for a moment. The qualities they show both themselves, and towards others, show a level of loving integrity that no other romance scenes from any other movie, [...] or straight, has ever showed, and yet you refused to call it love. Let me ask you a question, if what they show is not love, then what is?If the displays of love and affection between these men do not come logical to you, it is because Ang Lee had to delete scenes from the original script so that narrow minded people like you won't be offended by it. If love between two men is the reason you don't like this movie, then perhaps it is time that you expand your horizon and be more accepting towards all forms of love, instead of expecting director Ang Lee to place a limit on love for you. If the misery you see is what displeases you, then let it be a lesson to you to create a more pleasant and accepting world for everyone so that these tragedies, which is still occurring in modern society, will never happen again. Finally, if you rated an movie that provokes new thoughts and emotions within the viewers, depths of understanding towards human nature, and a cry for a different way to live as 3 stars and below, then know that this is how you rate your integrity, as there is simply no reason to compromise true beauty towards your personal bias.Now let's look at this movie once again. Does this movie has a script that has depth, content, and provocative yet beautiful? Yes! Does this movie have a director that truly gets the inner beauty of the script, and enhances it while playing it out to the world? Yes! Does this movie has extraordinary actors and filmed with extraordinary theatrical skills? Yes! Does this movie that satisfied all criteria that define an once-in-a-lifetime, extraordinary movie, and even exceed all criteria and expectations and come out on top deserve an honor of the highest regard? Most definitely!In fact, Jack Nicholson, who announced the result for the best picture of the year, is the exact person that said that he refuses to watch a movie as single minded as Broke Back Mountain. Apparently he and the entire Oscar board decided that they can critic a movie without even laying an eye on it! But Broke Back Mountain is still chosen by the people, and received an extraordinary 8 nominations to Oscar. The same is true to all viewers of Broke Back Mountain. This movie deserves 5 stars if not more, and that's what needs to appear on the Amazon rating page. We cannot allow narrow minded individuals who can only see a surface that is covered by propaganda, and cannot delve into the deeper meaning of this movie pull down the rating that this movie actually deserves. Let us all give this movie a 5 stars on Amazon, and 10 stars in our books so that the prejudice of these idiots can be negated, and so that this movie can get the rating it truly deserves!
I very much love Brokeback Mountain the movie, I read the story as well and felt that Ang Lee followed it perfectly. I would recommend this movie to anyone, gay, straight, and undecided, because it is a genuine love story.Sadie
This film was incredible.  It portrayed the years on how gay lifestyle had to be to the dot.  It shows that true love can be found anywhere.  I didn't like the ending, I know they like to keep you wondering at the end of a movie.  This just left too much up in the air I suppose. It definately was a tear jerker.  The experience at the theater did not go as well.  Watched several people walk out during the movie, and actually someone walked to the front right infront of the screen and yelled "you people really want to watch these f#*&%*#?"  I could not believe it, with all the talk everyone had to have known it was a gay oriented movie before they paid to see it.
For many days now I have lingered on this film. I recently rented it off of Netflix, and I was stunned by how much it moved me. For the longest time I avoided seeing this film, because I was afraid of how I would feel about it. Not for it's subject matter, I have sat through and enjoyed many gay themed films. I feared more that this was just another over-hyped oscar winning dissapointment, Like so many other oscar winners over the past few decades. Personally I was deeply moved by this film.  There are very many lessons to be learned from Brokeback Mountain. Not necessarily about homosexuality, but about the nature of love itself. Brokeback Mountain makes you realize how powerful a force like love is. It can create such beauty and passion. Yet at the same time destroy lives with the intensity of a furious hurricane. The main thing I liked about the picture, is that it doesn't take sides. Every character in this film is a victim. Jack and Ennis are both lonely and miserable, while Alma and Lureen have to suffer through infidelity and loveless marriages. They could have easily turned this film into a mockery of itself, although people make fun of it anyway, it never made a wrong turn for me.The performances are revolutionary. I really agree with people who put Heath Ledger's performance up there with Brando. He completly embodied Ennis Del Mar, the way Charlize Theron embodied Aileen Wurnos in "Monster. The moment where he breaks down in the alleyway after Jack left just really tears you up. Saying that, I have to say as great as Jake Gyllenhaal was in this film, I did think he was bit overshadowed by Ledger. But I really loved the way that you could guess what he was feeling just from his facial expressions. One scene that comes to mind, is the one where he is dancing with Lureen and you can see this sadness in his eyes as he turns away from her, like he is pining for something pining for Ennis.Michelle Williams is an incredible actress, I've seen her in Wendy and Lucy and Synechdoche,NY, and it amazes me that she hasn't gotten more recognition then she's already recieved, the moment when she see's Ennis from the porch she shows such a genuine reaction.This was also a huge breakout movie for Anne Hathaway, who before had only been known for playing disney princesses.Out of all the films Ang Lee has directed this is probably my favorite of his, or at least tied with The Ice Storm. It amazes me how versatile  he continues to be from doing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to Sense & Sensibility. I recently heard that he was set to do the Film adaptation of "Life of Pi" and if it is anywhere as good as this adaptation of Annie Proulx's story(which is worth a look) then I will be eternally grateful.
Dont know how this got in my review request list.
"Brokeback Mountain" is the love story of a lifetime.  It's about two cowboys in Wyoming (the home state of that pig Cheney) who fall in love and start a 20 year romance.  I will be STEAMED if this movie loses at the Academy Awards.  It better win or I'll get REAL angry!
This film was awesome. Far exceeded my expectations. This film leaves you speachless, full of emotion, grabs hold of you and does not let go. It hit me like a ton of bricks after I got home.
"brokeback Mountain" is a love story that reduced me to tears.  It's up for 8 Oscars including Best Picture, and it's getting great reviews everywhere.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal tear up the screen as two men who start a forbidden romance unbeknownst to their wives.  I think this movie will soon be remembered as a classic.  Ignore those who won't see this movie, for they don't know what they're missing.  "Brokeback Mountain" is great!  I can't wait for the DVD!
This is a very awesome movie, I watched it six times in the first week of having it.
This motion picture is habit-forming to an extensive degree. I watch it every day, sometimes twice or three times in the same day. It is difficult to stop watching.
Heath Ledger does an amazing transformation performance. He is so in character, you know who this guy is. You've seen him around on the American landscape. A very reserved, quiet young man raised in the back roads amongst pain and prejudice--a man who has gained strength simply by enduring while avoiding becoming another of the perpetrators--but that strength also clamps down around him and shuts him up. He is trapped in his strength and much of his energy is simpy spent on keeping his tightly knotted self-preservation intact.. Along comes Jack Twist.That first sexual encounter really comes out of left field. There wasn't anything beforehand that suggested that we should expect it or that those kinds of feelings, whatever those feelings were supposed to be, were growing in these characters, and I'd say that was the film's one big flaw. There was no real sense of a romance brewing, nor even lust--at least, not in the Ennis character and only very faint hints in the Jack character. Perhaps that was Ang Lee's bowing down to the reality of what the mass audience would tolerate, or upon what the film studio would tolerate considering the financial risk. Or maybe it was simply that that particular kind of romance is such uncharted territory in a major motion picture that both the movie maker and the mass audience are at a complete loss to negotiate any conventional terms for portraying it. The shared visual lexicon in film simply doesn't have the conventions yet to portray this kind of "romance," so only with baby steps, film by film, can the  journey into this territory begin. Female gay romance has been dealt with many more times than male gay romance in mainstream film. Actually, I can only think of one or two films before this one that has made the attempt.What Lee uses is a mixture of passion and brutality to depict their early relationship, but does that actually reveal their deep affection? Under their circumstances, for these two characters, maybe it does. Maybe their interiors are so tightly bound up by exteriors of cultural and self-inflicted constrictions that only on the back of violence can the two interiors break through to each other. But to buy this first sex scene you'd almost have to buy into some kind of undetectable telepathy that's been going on between Ennis and Jack because you certainly don't see any real evidence of anything brewing at this level before the tent scene. And actually, the why's and wherefore's of the attraction are never really revealed in the film, especially for Ennis, and Ennis's later excitement at seeing Jack and then running headlong into passion with him also seemed out of character. He wasn't "queer," he had said earlier.  What happened? The interiors of these homosexual feelings are not really explored at all. It all just happens. And as someone else has mentioned, that first sex scene does, in a way, reinforce stereotypes about gay sex, and also suggests that the situation is not unfamiliar to Ennis since he seems to know about, and  go right into, the expected action. This is strange since we're never given any suggestion of a history of previous gay encounters for Ennis. On the contrary, he's about to, matter-of-factly, marry a woman. There are moments in this tale, though, when you see it really is about love, just basic love--moments which may take non-gays (like myself) out of any prevailing prejudices for a few heartbeats and see that it truly is possible.The level of drama in this film is exceptional. This is very sophisticated story telling using the film medium. Lee proves again his remarkable resourcefulness and ability to focus sharply on subject matter that one would not expect from someone from a completely different culture. The depiction of the west/midwest here is deep and very convincing. You would think this could only be the product of an American movie maker. There are microscopic provincial idiosyncrasies in this film that Lee shouldn't know anything about. Who is this guy, Ang Lee? How does he do it, time after time? How does this foreigner get it so right? I've been a big fan of his since "Eat, Drink, Man, Woman," which I watched three times at the theater when it first came out. Little did I know then what a peculiar direction his career would go in after that.
Voil&agrave; pr&egrave;s de trois mois que j'ai vu ce film. Je suis retourn&eacute; le voir sept fois. &Agrave; chaque fois, mon cur s'est serr&eacute;. &Agrave; chaque fois, j'en ai appris davantage sur ma propre vie. &Agrave; chaque fois, j'ai eu envie d'en apprendre davantage. C'est indiscutable : ce film est le seul, depuis longtemps, &agrave; avoir autant provoqu&eacute; de r&eacute;actions enthousiastes. C'est le film le plus prim&eacute; de 2005. C'est aussi un film qui d&eacute;clenche un syndrome (non-contagieux, h&eacute;las), une esp&egrave;ce de folie douce. Un regard compassionnel au monde. C'est plus qu'un chef-d'uvre, n'en d&eacute;plaise &agrave; certains critiques de cin&eacute;ma : c'est un &eacute;v&eacute;nement inoubliable. Ennis et Jack sont devenus aussi l&eacute;gendaires que Rom&eacute;o et Juliette.
It takes your breath away. The film is so powerful and so beautiful. After reading all the reviews I should say I'm surprised the gay population is so narrow-minded to see it as  a gay movie. It is a devastating love story between two human beings. I think everybody should see it just to see how somebody can love, because that's why we all live, not everybody is that lucky though to find it.I will be buying it on DVD and probably watching it several times a year.The acting is superb! Good job everybody...
"Brokeback Mountain" is a beautiful love story for our time.  It is superbly scripted, sensitively directed, beautifully filmed, with inspired acting and a message that all Americans need to hear.
"Brokeback Mountain" opened in a few large cities and has slowly rolled out into the rest of the country.  Along the way, it's picked up nominations from nearly every critics group and for every award possible.  Thus, when some people across the country finally have the opportunity to view "Brokeback Mountain," it will have been built up incredibly.  I'm sure many people are very eager to see the "gay cowboy" movie that's winning so many awards.  Unfortunately, I think some people may be disappointed.  "Brokeback Mountain" is ultimately a small film, even if it does break some barriers.  There have been hundreds of successful gay films, but somehow this one, largely because it twists the western mythos of macho straight cowboys, has already attained almost mythical stature.  But please remember that it's a small, leisurely-paced movie.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play the cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist.  In 1963, they're hired by a rancher to watch a flock of sheep on a forlorn mountaintop. Indeed, both have lead pretty desolate lives - Ennis was orphaned early, and Jack's father was a cruel jerk, as we witness later.  Being a cowboy was obviously a hard life and the best they can hope for is to get some steady ranch work.  Long days together lead to the inevitable small talk and whiskey drinking as well as something else unforeseen - sex.However, whatever surprise the two men feel about having sex together seems dwarfed by the shock that they've found something in each other that they've never found anyplace else.  Different viewers may disagree about what Ennis and Jack see in each other; some may see the acceptance between the men or the end to their loneliness that they find together.  Whatever it is, they never find it again.  After the leave the mountain, they separate - Ennis marries quickly and Jack eventually follows suit.  Four years passes before they see each other again; unexpectedly to them, their feelings for each other are completely undiminished.  So begins a 20 plus year relationship marked with yearning that will never be satisfied.To some audiences, this film will just be a gay love story.  However, I think it's much closer in tone to one of Ang Lee's prior films, "Sense and Sensibility."  Jane Austen specialized in love stories where characters' longing to be together is often outweighed by the price of being together.  At one point, Jack offers to spend his life with Ennis, but Ennis, always the more pragmatic of the two, knows that two men living together in 1960s Wyoming would be nearly impossible.In all aspects, "Brokeback Mountain" is finely wrought.  Ang Lee's direction is up to his usual high standard, and the cinematography is breath-taking.  The script is from Pulitizer winner Annie Proulx's fine short story and was adapted by another Pulitzer winner, Larry McMurtry.  In many ways, the film's simple portrait of the West is similar to McMurty's work in classics such as "Hud" and "The Last Picture Show."  The supporting cast is uniformly good, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway.  However, the revelation is truly Heath Ledger.  Aside from his work as the son of a racist in 2001's "Monster Ball," he hasn't shown much acting promise.  Nevertheless, he perfectly captures Ennis.  He's likely to be nominated for an Oscar and perhaps even challenge Philip Seymour Hoffman "("Capote") for the win.  Indeed, it's likely that "Brokeback Mountain" will win more than a few Oscars this year, and it's most worthy of the attention.
In my view, "Brokeback Mountain" is the most meaningful and important film to be made in my lifetime.  That is saying a lot, seeing I broke into the movie theater business as a projectionist at age 15, became a film exhibitor at age 17, and my 76th birthday is coming up in a few days.  I've seen a lot of movies!I'm a gay man - have been all my life.  But that's like saying "Brokeback Mountain" is a "gay cowboy movie."  It doesn't begin to tell the whole story."Brokeback Mountain" hit me like a lightning bolt.  I lived 50 years before I began to see anything representative of my life on any "silver" screen anywhere.  I lived over 75 years to see anything honest and real about gay men's lives in a movie.  That movie was "Brokeback Mountain."So much of my own life is depicted in "Brokeback Mountain."  I fell in love with a boy in high school.  He never knew; I never told him.  I longed for him in silence.  In 1948, where I lived, a boy didn't tell another boy he loved him.  My secret love still haunted me when I got married at age 23 - because it never occurred to me that I could escape marriage.I had a number of affairs with men during fifteen years of marriage, which astoundingly nobody, including my wife, picked up on.  When the burden of lies got to be too heavy to carry, I told my wife I was gay.  She and 3 children paid the price of societal intolerance when this happened.  This follows the story line of "Brokeback Mountain" to a spooky degree - and this is why the film will doubtless change the rest of my life.  I know that at last people who would never know what gay men have gone through - and still do go through - now know because "Brokeback Mountain" came into their lives.  I find great comfort in that.
Read all the reviews and finally had to add my two cents. Saw the movie many times in the theatre and now with DVD many times.It seems to get better with each viewing.  I agree with all the positive reviews here.  Most of the negative reviews weren't even reviews of the movie, just soap box stuff.I hope that the Academy voters DO watch it sometime now on DVD.  I'm sure they will kick themselves in the [...] for the way they acted based on media hype and NOT the actual product.  You'd think that 'professional people' would know better.Check out Heath and Jake's previous work, pretty impressive for a couple of 25 yr olds. I think it's all available on Amazon.I'm looking forward to their future work.So, that's it. Just wanted to add my 5 stars to the tally.
Brokeback Mountain is a movie so ahead of our time that people are yet able to keep up with it.Allow me to explain myself.A few centuries ago, marriage is about power and benefits. Familys wed off their daughters to the rich and powerful so that they may receive the benefits of that marriage. Social classes are also very strictly governed, but eventually, human beings found that all people are equal, and abandoned the status system. Now, because the Church is homophobic, it exercises a cult-like exercise and brainwash everyone into thinking that homosexuality should be condemned. But when the emotions are so strong, it will outgrow all social conditionings. This movie shows the cruelty we have created the world to be, but unfortunately, people have yet become so accepting. Perhaps if the movie is released a few decades later, people will not be so small minded, and will embrace this movie for the love story it holds.
This is a beautiful and very sad film that visibly demonstrates  the effects of a suppressed and secret passion. Not only the two lovers suffer, but everyone with whom they become involved. The deliberately slow pace of the film mirrors the gradual unfolding of the passion between the two guys. Who cannot believe in and feel for Heath Ledger's character? The cinematography, cast and music all contribute to a staggering emotional effect. I will never forget this film.
I found out that I can 'purchase' the music (piano/vocal) book from the movie - TWILIGHT!  And that I can purchase a 'used' music book.  So much cheaper and the book was in great condition.  Thank you
Gus G plays for Ozzy and Firewind and really rips on the guitar. I thought because he was Greek that it may be hard to understabd but he speaks perfect english. He goes through scales rhythms, complete leads and tons of techniques I highly recomend this program!
Bought this for my Zoology lab at another university (Not Southern Ct State) and have yet to find a difference between it and my classmates' version, even though they paid $105 for theirs.
I've had mine now for years. I'm now just writing a review. It is lightweight, puts out a good amount of light even when reading in the complete dark. I've learned when the light starts dimming, you want to replace the battery, not the bulb. I ordered the blue one. I highly recommend this product. The clip is still in good shape, even after having it so long.
DVD that goes with the first 2 Fretboard Logic books. Everything was as described. Fretboard Logic is a great product that helps you understand the music rather than just copying it blindly. I'm glad I made this purchase.
I have an old BCB-6 Boss pedal board and it was the last pedal to fill the box.  The Phaser is what I needed, because I play lots of 60's and 70's rock and phasers were used a lot then. This worked like a dream.  Thanks so much.
I bought this violin as an adult student/intermediate player, so I wouldn't have to take my grandfather's 1920's fiddle out of the house frequently due to its sentimental value. I was a little skeptical at first because I didn't see anyone else buying the Vif violin. I decided to take a chance and figured I could use the return policy if I wasn't satisfied. I got the violin very quickly and it was packaged very nicely and arrived in perfect condition. The bridge was set up and all I had to do is center it and tune the violin. The strings are new and they will stretch in the beginning so you will have to re-tune the violin several times before the tuning settles. The tuning pegs were a little slippy but if you push in on them &#34;gently&#34; while raising &#34;gently&#34; to pitch they stay put. The fit and finish of the violin was very good but it was not glossy like the picture. Very nice ebony fingerboard, chin rest and pegs. The tone of the violin is very sweet and has lots of volume. You'd probably get a nicer tone with higher quality strings, but for a beginner/intermediate player, the strings are just fine. The included bow is actually very nice and has a good weight and feel. The included rosin takes to the horse hair bow very nice. Make sure you lightly scratch the rosin surface to help it to stick to the bow hair faster. The case is very nice and has storage for two bows and a compartment for accessories. It is a lightweight case and protects the violin very well. Overall you can't go wrong with this very nice beginner/intermediate violin. I highly recommend it!
I give it 5 stars for the thumb piano, the guitar, the vocals, and the melodies.  This music is beautiful, soothing, and relaxing.  However, behind the calm, the rhythms and patterns created by the instruments are complex and almost hypnotic.This is not rock music; rather, I would call it a mix of sophisticated pop and traditional Eastern African music.  This album may be a bit too 'Pure Moody' for some people; however, I don't particularily like new age music, but I like this: I feel the intricacy of the music rescues it and keeps it from being too bland.  As well, the lyrics are hardly the stuff of easy-listening music, dealing as they do with the assassination of the composer's father, and Oryema's exile from his homeland.Of course, the meaning of the songs is obscured from most of us in the West.  Only one song is in English; the others are sung in Swahili or Acoli.  The liner notes provide a summary in English of each song's meaning.This is a beautiful cd.  From experience playing it at work, most people like it on first hearing, and, due to its complexity, the music will continue to grow on you.
As a music teacher, I showed this video to my students many times.  They always loved it and some of Beethoven's music became known to them through this.  In this case, I ordered it for my oldest granddaughter and I hope she is enjoying it as well.
This Emmy-winning film is visually beautiful and moving, and also very accurate historically. Like the boy in the movie, a real-life young boy named Gerhard von Breuning enjoyed a special relationship with the composer while residing nearby. As an adult, von Breuning wrote about his experiences in a book titled after the name of Beethoven's building, Aus dem Schwarzspanierhaus. The talented actor who plays Beethoven (Neil Munro) looks remarkably like pictures of Beethoven from this period in his life. Much of the dialogue is drawn from Beethoven's own letters, conversation books, and other writings, and most of the action really took place. The musical score includes performances of Beethoven's masterpieces by some of the best international performers. This is one of my favorite DVDs, and very popular with friends to whom I have lent it. Highly recommended.
Beautiful music, scenery and good acting from all the people involved in such a charming movie.Children oriented, very inspirational!
My grandson would not move from the TV until this has finished.  It is very well done.  So glad I found it.
This video tells the story of a young boy whose father has recently died and whose mother has now rented the upstairs of their home to an eccentric composer, Ludwig van Beethoven.  The deaf composer bangs around at all hours of the day and especially night as he works on his 9th Symphony.  The video presents a very human picture of the great composer, struggling with his loss of hearing.  A connection is made between boy and composer which is touching.  This film is an excellent way to pique a beginner musician's interest in the music of Beethoven and in Beethoven himself.
I like this speaker. I bought a pair of K10s because I wanted a stereo image for my piano and the clarity and presence are phenomenal. Un-muddied left hand bass and crisp high notes. I'm hearing subtleties in my keyboard that I haven't heard before. I'm using them on stands behind me in my Irish band to mic an accordion and tin whistle and they both sound great with these speakers running through an 8 channel Yamaha mixer.At 32lbs, they're easy to carry around, especially with the totes, and light to get up on stands. These speakers go really loud, so it's nice that I can set the speaker fader only half way and still get good volume. Really helps prevent feedback from the condenser  mics.
Well let me tell you i was an mackie srm 450 user very good powered speaker but when i read about this k10's i can't resist to try  it, I'm a Wedding Dj in Cancun & my gigs are max for 100 pax & i used  one pair stand alone k10's & my work goes perfect! The sound it's very similar like upa 10 from Meyer sound but less weight.I just order another pair of this babes!
John is one of the absolute masters on his instrument which flows with the true spirit of Americana.  The others on the CD are his some of his usual posse, also some of the very best at their craft.  This is a great CD for any musician or anybody who loves to hear real instruments played at their highest caliber. Highly Recommended.
Picture you are in the 1930's.  A seaplane takes off in the water in a harbor as you watch the sun go down.  Vintage saling ships and merchant steam boats bob in the water.  The warm evening breeze blows palm leaves and the smell of afro-carribean cooking mingles with flowering bouganvilla and hibiscus.  You are sitting in a restaurant as ceiling fans stir cigar smoke and the background sounds of a calypso band play for your enjoyment.  Tourism hasn't exploited this island yet and you realize just how far away from home you actually are.These recordings will take you to this time and place.
The calypso music of the 1930s and 40s was a music of a different era. It creates images of a Jamacia that is long gone, a legendary and lost time. Anyone interested in the Calypso music of the 30s and 40s should start with this compilation. It has all the big players of the genre, such as Lord Beginner, Atilla the Hun, and Lion (who contributes my favorite track on the entire compilation "Love Thy Neighbor"). The music itself is unique and accesible at the same time, making for an incredibly fresh listening. The truth remains that this was a seminal period in music history, and this is an excellent portrait of the musical genre. A great introduction to the genre (some company needs to produce a box set of this stuff).
THIS IS A GREAT DISCO AND HOUSE MUSIC HIP HOP CLASSIC CD. THAT IS A MUST PLUS FOR YOUR COLLECTION AND EARS. FROM VETERAN DJ, MASTERSOUND PERRY.
Superb,  Hovie, Jake and JD are brilliant, James Blackwood, not so good, but this doesn't spoil the over all sound.  Hovie's piano excels J D. is amazing and Jake as ever never lets the side down.  I really love this and highly recommend it to all southern Gospel fans.
I love these cds!  I listen to them in the car, mostly, where I need to relax.  The music is beautiful, soothing, inspiring!
Peter and Gordon are primarily known for their hit song "A world without love" which was penned by John Lennon and Paul McCartney of Beatle fame. Therefore they are often written off as second class musicians, their names only of note in the context of Beatle history. However, they were and are far more than this, as seen, or more appropriately, as heard in this double album CD released on the Collectables label.At the time of this review I have noted that there are only two other critiques listed for this CD. One states that Peter and Gordon only released six albums which is incorrect, they released far more than that. The Collectables label chose to only release six of their titles. The remaining albums are, in my humble opinion, more than worthy for digital release, especially the wonderful "In London for tea" and I wish that Collectables would make these titles available as well.But on the topic of this double album set we are presented with a strong track listing that ranges from ballads to blues effortlessly. There is a blues-inspired cover of Presley's "All shook up"- a rendition so breathless and fresh that it rivals the original. There is the original "Tears don't stop", a big beat composition that could easily belong on the seminal album "Begin here" released by their peers The Zombies in 1965. The Zombies were and are one of the stronger bands to emerge from the "British Invasion", so when you consider that Asher and Waller matched their writing ability on this tune, we are left to conclude that they are stronger musicians than they are given credit for. I agree with the second critique that they were certainly more than capable of penning their own songs, and further proof of this lies in the tune "Hurting is loving", an ethereal haunting "wall of sound" number that could have easily been used as the opening to a James Bond film.There are of course the standard hits here as well, "I go to pieces" and "True love ways" to name but two, and one listen will certainly confirm why they were hits. They more than deserved to be. However, there is so much more as well and this double album set will not disappoint if you are a fan of the British 60's sound, or plainly put, of excellent music in general.
Peter and Gordon recorded six albums together in the mid-sixties. Collectables have released them all on three CD's, including as bonus tracks some singles that didn't appear on any of those original albums. This is the middle pairing, containing the third and fourth of the six albums, with one bonus track (Sunday for tea). The songs are mainly soft, mid-tempo ballads. The major hits here are I go to pieces, To know you is to love you and True love ways, but if those songs are what you're thinking of buying this for, you might be better with a greatest hits instead.Apart from the above hits, this CD includes two minor hits (Don't pity me and Sunday for tea), a few interesting but unexceptional original songs and plenty of covers, including two Everly Brothers (Sleepless nights and Crying in the rain) and two Elvis (All shook up and A mess of blues).This is a wonderful, relaxing CD, which contrasts nicely with a lot of the other pop music of the time, which was generally more upbeat.
I still can't believe amazon had this I have been looking forever for this on CD really is great thanks
this goldband stuff is incredible....so many cool and unknown artists...Big Chenier....you cant get more funky and groovin than him...some of this stuff is so obscure.....lots of great guitar playing..some but not a lot of zydeco...its rock..its blues...its swamp pop..classic stuff.....from a magic region of the South..
Having been introduced to Mr. Shirley when my father first began collecting his vinyl recordings, I have searched for years to find his  works on CD.  To me and to my extended family as well, Mr. Shirley's music  has been entertaining, inspring and comforting.  Our only regret is that  mainstream music America seems to know so little about this incredible  musician and human being.  THANK YOU for making his music available, and  for anyone remotely interested - DO NOT MISS THIS MUSIC.  We anxiously  await more releases of his work.
This was the first CD I purchased through Amazon.com, and at that time did not want to take the time to write a review since no one else had (at that time) and I thought I might be alone in my affection (need for!) more Don  Shirley music.  Now I see there are 15 reviews.  I'm not alone after all!  We need more of Don Shirley's recordings released on CD!  I think he was  one of the great performers of his time, and this recording is an excellent  illustration of his artistry.  By the way, I think I read that he died in  1998.  I hope I'm wrong.  One final note -- if anyone sees other CD's of  Don Shirley music, I would certainly like to know about it.
No jazz pianist phrases better than Don Shirley.  He combines power, range and subtlty.  The Don Shirley Trio LP album that was issued in the mid-60s is a tour de force, and several of those cuts are featured on this CD.  Why  his music hasn't received more attention from jazz critics and anthologists  is a mystery.  I am grateful, after years of combing record stores and  searching the net, that at least some of his music has been issued on CD.  Enjoy!
I was excited to find this disc via the internet.  I am aware that Sony has a site where one can submit requests for archival CBS recordings.  I hope everyone who likes Don Shirley will let them know they have a market  out there
I have been a fan of Don Shirley since his first records came out eons ago and had given up finding his music after my LP's were lost.  His piano style is unlike any other and if you love a soft but powerful jazz piano,  this is the best.  Please let's see more of him for those of us who have  been looking so long.
Don Shirley has a style that is so fantastically smooth and easy.  I love this CD and am anxiously awaiting his next one.  I hope he does dozens more!
One would think that with pop radios cruel and racist embargo on funk/soul/R&B; during the early 80's that an artist as eclectic and individual as Johnny Guitar Watson would'nt have stood a chance of surviving. In his case,it was probably the other way around. With everyone scrambling for a more uniform musical sound to stay afloat,it seemed as if the ones with the most distinction would be the most enduring. Watson had always been more than a survivor. He'd been a champion of the blues form,not by keeping it the same but by innovating within the spectrum of soul,funk and finaly disco. Now all he could really do musically was be himself,at the creative possition he was in at the time. So characterisitcally he took what might've been an icy road in his career and too a wild gamble:make a one man band album.With the exception of drums on one track Watson plays all the instruments on this album,hense the title mildly inspired by George Clinton. The interesting part of this album is how much of a garagey style jazz-funk album it is. Not only is the instrumentation spare but so is the production. "Family Clone" and "What Is Love" actually have a great deal of improvised melodies with Watson scatting smoothly in and around them. It's only natural however that the more bottom heavy funk grooves in the smoother groove "Forget The Jonses" and the pulsing uptempo "Ain't Movin" make it clear he's not changing his playing or writing style no matter what's popular or isn't. "Come And Dance With Me" is my favorite,inspired somewhat by Herbie Hancock it's a very jazzy blues funk entirely sung on vocorder. This was when Roger & Zapp were just coming out so it seemed right on time there too.On "Rio Dreamin" he brings that Brazillian bug into the groove. Usually a style associated with bands,Watson pulls off the latin rhythms in a very good yet different way by himself. The albums ends with the harder funk of "Voodoo What You Do",dealing lyrically with how different spiritual systems seem to always come together somewhere. This album plays out a bit differently than a lot of Johnny Guitar Watson albums. It has none of the epic,sometimes brassy flavors of most of his funk era albums. It has the production values of a very garagey blues album. On the other hand it's musically in keeping with the direction he was going in on hisGiantandLove Jonesalbums,and that was towards something of an urban pop jazz style. But done up in this spare and garagey multi instrumentalist sort of way gives it a very unique character and it's one of my favorite albums Watson made.
1. Pop in Cd2. Press Play3. Enjoy
I retired from the club scene 5 years ago, swore off techno three years ago, and this is still my favorite CD. 22 tracks and over 90 minutes of pulse pounding bliss. This album flat out rocks.This is one of those rare compilation discs that any DJ in the country could put on at 2:00AM, walk away and go do his taxes (hahaha) or wallpaper his bathroom, then come back and the house would still be jumpin. Its that good. Listen to K.Kat, my new favorite reviewer, this collection has few peers. 5 Rolls
This Spem emphasizes balance between its eight choirs.  The Tallis Scholars' performance, initially more spectacular thanks to its brighter acoustic and the more virtuosic pre-eminence of the trebles, for me finally loses more of harmonic complexity than  it gains in intensity.  The accent on the treble part overwhelms the majestic interweaving of harmonies, which this recording displays to awesome effect.  To me, the Tallis Scholars' Spem is like a spectacular display of fireworks, while The Sixteen's is ocean waves crashing against cliffs.  This reviewer is grateful for both.
Thomas Tallis (1505 - 1585): Sacred Choral Works: Spem in alium - Te lucis ante terminum - O nata lux - from the Lamentations of Jeremiah - O sacrum convivium - Jesu salvator saeculi - Salvator mundi, salva nos - Loquebantur variis linguis - Gaude gloriosa Dei Mater. Performed by The Sixteen, dir. Harry Christophers. Recorded in St. Jude's Church, London, from 15th to 17th October 1989. First issued in 1990 as Chandos Chaconne 0513. Total playing time: 64'50".Thomas Tallis is perhaps the best-known of the 16th century English renaissance composers. After assuming posts at Dover Priory and Canterbury Cathedral (among others), he was for 40 years until his death "Gentleman" (= kapellmeister) of the Chapel Royal, where he managed to survive the ups and downs of the Reformation and the persecutions of the counter-reformation party. Among his pupils was William Byrd, together with whom he published the Cantiones sacrae (1575). Byrd mourned for Tallis at his death in the song "Ye Sacred Muses".English church music of the 16th century represents, like so much else from this period, something of a summit in English culture. Medieval polyphony was developed further, and by using five- or six-voiced choirs (with high sopranos or boy trebles) church-filling sounds were produced which, on the one hand, tended to quiet meditation, on the other hand produced unparalleled excitement. Most of the pieces on this CD correspond to this description, although I should add that Harry Christophers nowhere uses boy trebles; instead, he opts for really high female soprano voices. Passages of great density are alternated with passages of homophony, based on Gregorian chant, normally sung by the tenors and basses.The one exception to the rule is the motet "Spem in Alium", a piece written for eight choirs with forty (!) voices. Tallis appears to have written it as the answer to a similar piece composed by Alessandro Striggio. It must be a magnificent experience to hear this piece sung live, but the recording is, in my opinion, rather distant and able more to demonstrate the limits of a stereo system than really to excite. In order to capture the "cathedral sound" more genuinely, the Chandos engineers have placed the microphones comparatively far away from the singers, and the listener will probably have the feeling of sitting some way back in a large church where the choir or choirs are placed near the altar.The texts which Tallis has set to music are printed in the booklet in Latin, English, French and German. They reflect the changing times in which Tallis lived. Here we find unashamed Mariology from his youthful period before the Reformation (Gaude gloriosa Dei Mater) right through to texts that any Protestant could say "Amen" to.At this point I feel I must honour the performance by the Sixteen Choir. Despite the distance between the singers and the microphones, it can be plainly heard (perhaps even more plainly on headphones), how unusually crisp, clean and precise the singing is. This is absolute professionalism! I cannot remember ever hearing a choral performance which bettered this one.
A truly beautiful and uplifting choral work.Tallis has heard the voice of God and put it on paper to be sung and enjoyed by all. Typical of the 15th century English choral style,it does not disappoint.
After years of listening to masses from Gregorian Chants to Stravinsky, I'm finally catching up with Hayden's masses, which fit very nicely between the mountainous heights of the works by Bach, Handel, and Mozart. I especially prefer this recording to a similar one with the Nelson mass paired with a Vivaldi Gloria mass. This recording is just a bit short as modern CDs go, but if you can get it at a nice discount, this one is a winner if you like masses or baroque / Classical music.
I am not an expert on music but enjoyed listening to this CD. It amazes me how someone can play such complicated pieces and then play so many notes so fast.
Beware Amazon's header, this is not the complete Poulenc piano music, just the four hand/duo stuff.But, luckily, it is an excellent survey, by far the best of recent vintage. Tanyel and Brown, not soloists on their day off but a true piano team, are totally sensitive to Poulenc's mixture of elan and tenderness. They get the saucy bounce of the little early sonata, the stark profundity of the later, greater one, and the time-stands-still sighing of the wonderful Elegie.And, as is not often the case, the two pianos are well recorded, sounding present but pleasant in a large room acoustic.
It is rare to find all five piano concertos in one CD that is of this quality. Wonderful recording and performances. The recent remake of this recording (2009)has even a more superb sound quality. No one can match Gutierrez's performance of the Prokofiev piano concerto no. 2. The cadenza is magnificent and electrifying! A must have for any collector of great performances. Gutierrez stands heads and shoulders above any recording ever made!
I found both works on this disc absolutely stunning, particularly the Overture.  Taneyev seems to combine the emotional impact of Tchaikovsky with a more refined technique.  There are many passages which seem to invoke the harmonic world of Brahms.  Highly recommended.  The performances direct by Jarvi are well done (if not terribly distinctive) and the audio engineering is superb.I will be searching for more recordings of works by Taneyev (I've already discovered the string quartets, and they are similarly superb.)
These rare choral works of Richard Strauss are just as magnificent as his orchestral works.  They are sublime pieces of music and if you haven't heard them before then buy this CD.  Exceptional choral singing from the Danish National Choir, recorded with a first-class Chandos recording.
I must disagree with the previous reviewer.  To my ear this is one of the finest Nielsen recordings available.  Firstly, it is comprised entirely of lesser known gems which reveal a gentler, more programmatic Nielsen than the one we are familiar with from his symphonies.  The realization of the story settings show the stroke of a master, and the orchestrations are simply breathtaking.  I find Rozhdestvensky's interpretation of this selection of short works to be perfect in every way.  I can't recommend it highly enough!
Tchaikovsky's Second Suite was written in 1884 when the opera Mazeppa was composed and was dedicated to his sister-in-law (who had married his brother Anatoly).  The composer was visiting his brother when he composed the suite and he is said to have used a cipher to include the names of his brother, his wife and their children in the first movement called "Play of Sounds". The suite is in five movements and contains some of Tchaikovsky's most melodious music which certainly deserves to be better known.  The second movement is a captivating waltz and the third an energetic scherzo.  The fourth movement is a beautiful andante titled Reves d'enfant, harkening back to the domestic atmosphere of his brother's home and depicting the adventurous dreams of the children.  The final movement is a dance cast in a baroque style and reminded me of the ballet music of Sleeping Beauty.The Tempest is an early work and was suggested to Tchaikovsky by Balakirev; it was composed in 1873 and was well received on its premiere.  It is an atmospheric depiction of the play by Shakespeare.  The music begins by depicting the sea moving into the action of the play where Prospero raises the storm that will ship wreck his enemies on his island.  The is a nice love music episode for Miranda and Ferdinand that is not as well known as the famous sequence from Romeo and Juliet but just as effective and passionate.  The orchestra is brought to a climax as Prospero relinquishes magic and we are returned to the sea music of the opening.  This is a beautifully conceived work that is not played often in concert and is somewhat difficult to bring off.  The performance by Neeme Jarvi and the Detroit Symphony effortlessly explores the orchestral textures, turning in a superb performance.
Truely awesome Cd.  It shows these guys at their best.  It well covers all their different talents from their great Gospel works to their Texas Swing to their light and airy fun songs.  I would truely say get this for your collection if you are a fan of The Bolick Brothers.  Perfect.
This is the sophomore release of the all-girl band from California featuring a 16 year-old Joan Jett and 17 year-old Lita Ford. Although this album received massive attention in Europe, it went virtually unnoticed in  the United States which is pretty amazing considering The Runaways were the  first all-girl band to write, arrange, and play rock and roll.
The runaways were the first to cut through the music fog and put it out the way they wanted to. They set out to do it and  made it happen. They hit right around the world with their' sound.  The group was short lived but the accomplishments were huge. It's a sound that I still get into. Buy &#34;The Queens Of Noise&#34; and  the self titled album &#34;The Runaways&#34;. You won't be disappointed.
So much fun to hear them again. Great to reminisce being a teen-ager. They were so hot when I was 13 years old.
Great sound and attitude on this CD.  A really underrated band that had a lot of heart, and a lot of talent.
&quot;Queens of Noise&quot;, the second album by The Runaways, is probably the best of all the albums. I know it is one of my all-time favorite albums. This is straight-ahead rock n roll. Litas lead-guitar licks are as good any males, if not better. Joans rhythm guitar playing and animalistic growls are what real rock n roll is all about. The rhythm section of Jackie Fox (bass) and Sandy West (drums) are faultless. Cherie Currie shows off her vocals nicely on the ballads &quot;Midnight Music&quot; and &quot;Heatbeat&quot;. This line-up is the best and probably best remembered. I'm still hoping for that Runaways reunion. By the way, does anyone out there know what ever happened to Jackie Fox? She was always my favorite Runaway. If you want good straight-ahead rock n roll, then by ths album. You won't be sorry.
If it were'nt for Run DMC, there would never have been Kid Rock, Linkin Park, or Limp Bizkit. Rap, hip hop, and hard rock combine to form one of the first bands/groups to develop this style of music. If you like the Beastie Boys you should like Run DMC. HARD rap n' rock connection makes for a &#34;turn it up loud in your face&#34; sound. Pioneering hip hop group of the century. Highest possible recommendation!
I LOVE THIS CD...I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT LIKES OLD SONGS ! BRINGS BACK A LOT OF GOOD MEMORIES
this was my husbands gift and he just loved it, now its my favorite I play it all the time.
If you like Reggae, you'll love Yellowman. I love listening to this while I'm stuck in traffic.  It keeps me mellow and happy and makes the drivers around me wonder why I've got such a big smile on my face.
Released in 1987, this is the final recording made by Liam Clancey and Tommy Makem before the duo split up. It's also by far the most interesting musically, and at least some of the credit goes to producer/musician/arranger extraordinaire Donal Lunny.Lunny, who's worked with just about everybody in the Irish music world, contributed bouzoukis, bodhrans and keyboards to the 13 songs. He also did much of the arranging, so much of We've Come A Long Way has more variety than previous M&amp;C recordings. Indeed, maybe there was too much variety for Makem. I interviewed him in the mid 1990s and when I mentioned how much I enjoyed this recording, he didn't have much to say. Perhaps it's no surprise, since he apparently didn't contribute any of his trademark tin whistle or banjo to the musical menu.Still, you'll be blown away by the silky, elegant ballads Roseville Fair, Golden and Queen of Connemara. Frog In The Well is a fun Clancey Brothers &amp; Tommy Makem standard redone here, and The Mary Ellen Carter is a feisty treatment of a folk classic by the late Canadian troubadour Stan Rogers.All in all, I'd say Makem and Clancey finished with their strongest recording.
What a great CD.  If you are fans of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem this is a great album to add to your collection.  These two are great on their own but together they can't be beat.  Too bad they are no longer with us.  They are the best.
Okay, so I'm a geezer. I first came across Hammond's stuff on the "Blues at Newport" LP, found this in a record store, and wasn't just impressed -- I was TERRIFIED. I once heard Warren Zevon say "It amazes me that Jagger got rich, while Hammond's still singing in bars." Absolutely. Check out "Parachute Woman" -- is Jagger doing a Hammond imitation or what? But this stuff is for grown-ups. All the fear, loneliness, and sleazy humor in this sector of American music is buried in Hammond's voice -- it grabs you by the throat.As an added bonus, this CD contains the acoustic side of "Mirrors," and the recordings of "Stones in My Passway" and "Death Don't Have No Mercy" are, IMO, definitive. Hammond's onetime buddy Jimi Hendrix could only manage to sound this despairing on a few of his best cuts.
I am a big fan this group.  They never let their fans down.  Harmony is great, song selection great, one could not ask for more.
Jack Jones has an easygoing singing style that always puts me in a relaxed mood, and putting on one of his CDs is like going out to a nightclub.  His choice of material is also excellent for his style, and this CD "The Mood is Love" has some of his prettiest selections.  The first tune "Live For Life" is by French composer Francis Lai who did "A Man & A Woman", and both the melody and lyrics are beautiful, about running off to travel the world with someone you love.  Beautiful renditions of Paul Anka's "Let Me Be the One" and two by Michel Legrand "The Windmills of Your Mind" & "Pieces of Dreams" are here, as well as "Somewhere" from West Side Story & the touching "Where Is Love" from Oliver.  This may well be my favorite Jack Jones album.  I was fortunate not to have any playing difficulties with this CD as some other reviewers have noted, though it IS a poorly produced CD with no booklet, just one slip w/ cover photo and the song titles on reverse which have no composer credits or song times.
This is music of astonishing quality and power. Bessie Tucker may not have the posthumous fame of the other Bessie, but she emerges from these scratchy but well remastered records as a genuine blues giant.This CD contains her complete output, including six alternate takes. Her ever-present accompanist is a distinctive and spontaneous pianist, K.D.Johnson. The 1929 tracks add a guitar and, sometimes, are anchored by a brass bassTucker's blues lyrics merit special attention, which her clear diction makes easy. Her concerns extend beyond familiar staples of men and infidelity to cover travel, railroads, prison camps and a broader than usual picture of southern rural life. It's unforgettable.No lover of blues should be without this.
The recording on this CD are the earliest known Blues that were recording to records a must for any serious blues collector
There is a wealth of material available on the slide guitar and vocals (as well as the kazoo playing) of Hudson Woodbridge, better known as Tampa Red, much of it dating back to his heyday in the 1920s and 1930s, but it seems like rounding up all four of his hit singles - registered between 1942 and 1951 - is to be a painful (and costly) process.Known widely as The Guitar Wizard for his ability on both the steel and electric guitar, he recorded everything from straight pop to jump, jive and, of course, blues, but it was mostly the latter that brought him fame, as evidenced by tracks such as Georgia, Georgia Blues and I Got A Right To Be Blue from the period covered by this release, and older stuff like Black Angel Blues and Crying Won't Help You.Late in 1942, recording for Bluebird, he had his first national hit when Let Me Play With Your Poodle (he was famous for double-entendre lyrics, once recording a song titled Tight Like That) rose to # 4 in January 1943 on what then passed for the R&B; charts b/w My First Love Blues (tracks 14 and 9) on Bluebird 34-0700. Featured on piano was Major Merriweather, better known as Big Maceo.Two years would then pass before he had another with Detroit Blues (track 15) which hit the # 5 slot in September 1945, this time with Blind John Davis on piano on Bluebird 34-0731 b/w Sure Enough I Do (track 20). Later that year he appeared as the featured guitarist on Big Maceo's Things Have Changed which peaked at # 4 in December on Bluebird 34-0735 b/w Kid Man Blues. Those sides are not included here.By the time of his last two hits, which came in 1949 and 1951, he was being released on the primary RCA Victor label. In September 1949 When Things Go Wrong With You peaked at # 9 b/w Come On, If You're Coming on RCA Victor 50-0019, and in October 1951 Pretty Baby Blues made it to # 7 b/w Since My Baby's Been Gone on RCA Victor 50-0136. Both feature Little Johnnie Jones on piano and will have to be found elsewhere.Born on December 15, 1903 in Smithville, Georgia, Tampa Red passed away on March 19, 1981 at age 77, but not before leaving behind a wealth of highly expressive vocals and some of the greatest examples of slide guitar you will ever have the pleasure of experiencing in this ambitious multi-volume series from Document, which has excellent sound reproduction and informative liner notes written by Alan Balfour.I recommend them all - I just grabbed this 12th volume because it had two of his biggest hits.
Elzadie Robinson, was a great blues/jazz singer in the 20's, this set of 17 songs needs to be re-evaluated by music historians.  Robinson deserves to be more well known then she is, her music hasn't dated at all, she often used top notch jazzmen of the era to back her up.  On this CD there are 17 songs by the virtually unknown Robinson, and six alternate takes by the even more obscure Lottie Beaman who sings pretty darn good too!  This set is recommended to 20's blues collectors as well as 20's vintage jazz lovers.
For my money, Victoria Spivey ranks up there with Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith.  She had good material -- blues, but other stuff too -- and did a terrific job with it.  On some of the tunes on this album she accompanies herself on the piano and does a good job.  The liner notes include a very good biography.
If anyone could claim to be one of the strongest voices for women, she would be Victoria Spivey and her piano. When one listens to Spivey's piano music, one can hear the future barrel-house piano of the nineteen-fifties. This is not music for the faint of heart!
This is Volume One(of two) is a series put out by the great Document label, of classic 20's blues singer Maggie Jones, who was often accompanied by top jazz musicians of the day.  The highlights of this wondeful disc(which cover everything she did between 1923-25) are the tracks that feature hot jazz solos by Louis Armstrong, who often backed up Jones in her studio sessions, also Fletcher Henderson appaers an many of these classic sides, among the most memorable of the tunes are Poor House Blues, Anybody Here Want To Try My Cabbage, Thunderstorm Blues and the classic If I Lose, Let Me Lose (Mamma Don't Mind).  This is classic blues at it's best, Jones' delivery is wonderful and with backup by Armstrong, and Henderson, this set is essential.  Collectors will want to pick this up for the hot Armstrong cornet solos.  Essential music.
Sara MaRTIN was alraedy past the age of 40 when she made these classic jazz sides with some of the best jazz musicians of the 20's.  Had she not retired she might have been in the same class as Mildred Bailey, or Conne  Boswell.  This cd includes a version of YES SIR THAT's MY BABY that is so  hot you won't believe taht a singer in 1925 could swing before the term was  even invented.  Ecxellent cd worth getting, especially for blues and jazz  collectors.
Oh my!  What a well-kept secret.  I accidentally found him, and he's fabulous!  Boogie Woogie, very different from the usual.
"Still Screaming" was Scream's debut album and contains an abundance of loud-fast numbers in the DC hardcore tradition ('Your Wars/Killer' and 'Human Behavior' are the best of these). Even at this early stage, however, songs like 'Solidarity', 'Laissez Faire', and 'Hygiene' indicated the eclectic--and occasionally even melodic--direction the band would take.The real treasure here is Scream's sophomore effort, "This Side Up". Whether it's acknowledged or not, this album is one of the crowning achievements of the DC punk movement, right up there with Minor Threat's first two 7"s or Soulside's "Hot Bodi-Gram". An incredibly mature and varied album for such a young band, "This Side Up" balances ferocious hardcore ('The Zoo Closes At Dark') with quasi-metal ('Iron Curtain'), spooky  minor-key reggae ('Still Screaming'), and brooding, folky rock with female backing vocals ('I Look When You Walk'). This is a genuinely great album that deserves more recognition.Personnel for the entirety of "Still Screaming" and the first half of "This Side Up": Scream's classic four-man lineup of Peter Stahl (vocals), Franz Stahl (guitar), Skeeter Thompson (bass), and Kent Stax (drums). A second guitarist, Robert Lee "Harley" Davidson, joined the group for the last five songs on "This Side Up" (and remained with them for their third album, "Banging the Drum"). Guest performers: Dr. Know (piano) and Dr. Night (saxophone) on 'Still Screaming'; Amy Pickering (backing vocals) on 'I Look When You Walk'.
While I'm down with the notion that punk offered anyone the chance to pick up an instrument, learn a  couple of chords and start playing, there is something especially satisfying about HC that features great playing and some craftsmanship.Scream certainly had that.  The playing is super-tight and they had some interesting musical ideas incorporated into what they were doing.  More than just a snapshot of a great time in music -- a superb collection of hardcore being pushed beyond its usual boundaries.Essential stuff for punk fans.
What can I say that I haven't already said about her magnificent voice and choice of harmonizing and music? You have to hear it to believe it's that good. Before you've even heard the entire song, you find yourself humming along with it. Get your copy now! They are getting harder to find and the prices are going up instead of down like most.
This CD captures the Miller sound in live performances during the band's first booking at the Meadowbrook Ballroom, which came about as a result of its having earlier snagged the Glen Island Casino gig for the 1939 summer season.  This period was a very significant one in the band's history, marking the beginning of its meteoric rise to national popularity.  The band's sound still had a few rough edges, but any technical lapses are more than compensated for by the engaging and elegant arrangements.  The announcer's introduction to Dipper Mouth Blues dedicating it to the University of Colorado is the only instance in which I have heard of Glenn's days there being mentioned on a recording.  The selection Oh, Baby! appears to be the only recording of the Miller band playing that song.  This nicely remastered CD is fun to listen to and a valuable addition to anyone's collection.
This volume from Jazzology contains a series of four live radio concerts from March, l947, under the auspices of Rudi Blesh, featuring an all-star ensemble of Muggsy Spanier, Joe Sullivan, George Brunies, guest Sidney Bechet, Art Hodes, Albert Nicholas, Baby Dodds, and others.  Although the tunes are what we call "chestnuts", available by some of these artists on other recordings, the enthusiasm and excitement generated are awesome. By all means, if you want to hear New York-Chicago traditional jazz, played by some of the icons of the trade, this is IT!
This is a very good Album the first one of a new project in Guadalajara. Good sound, good vocalist, and a very special sense of musicality, with nice messages in the lyrics. But Guadalajara did not have the time for something fresh and of good quality like Azul Violeta was offering. However, a selected group of people appreciate their music and that is probably what Azul Violeta wanted, of course they aimed to sell their music but the primary concern was to make good music. Good for Azul Violeta in this Fantastic album!
I heard this recording as a child and was transfixed by it. It transformed how I felt about the performance of early music. I have just finished the Douglas-Home biography and was thrilled to discover that the disc had been re-issued. It's simply a must-have, the closest we will ever come to hearing this music performed as it was intended to be.
Big fan here...earlier CD's raw and energetic.  This work studio smooth plus a new guitar that is actually in tune.  Very clean sound from this old bluesman. Really glad I added it to my "Lightning" collection.
This is a lotta Lightnin', a compilation of 2 albums recorded in 1964, with a running time of 76 minutes. I have been a fan of Lightnin' Hopkins for 40 years and have many of his recordings. The first 7 songs are are from the album Down Home Blues, which in my opinion is Lightnin's finest work ever. These cuts are really well recorded and showcase Lightnin' at his laid back best. The sound is very clear and showcases his incredible dynamics, going from fast & intense to whisper quiet. His stories and vocal inflections are just so right-on; my neck hairs still stand up when I hear it, 40 years after hearing it for the first time. His guitar playing is a treasure, going from rhythmic boogie to chilling single notes, with the best of his signature flourishes and flurries. Standing on 75 Highway and other slower songs have a heart rending intensity. This is the real deal!! Blues does not get any better than these 7 cuts!!Cuts 8-17 are from the Soul Blues record. Though these cuts lack the absolute magic of the first 7, they are still fine Lightnin'. Some of these (My Babe, for example) show off some of his flashier guitar work and show that he was one of the all time great blues guitarists and a foremost proponent of the Texas style. Some great story songs here too.If you are new to the blues, this CD will be a fine introduction. If you are a seasoned blues fan and collector, you would be remiss not to have this one! I could listen to just those first 7 songs for days!
Quite simply, this is one of the all-time-great 60's jazz albums!Until recently, it was an expensive Japanese vinyl import but now its generally available on CD. The classic modal tune'Dorian' is one of those tracks which is so good that you think you must have heard it before - but you havent! Booker Ervin is at his peak on this album, which is as good as the best albums on Blue Note. Dont hesitate - buy! No collection is complete without it!
Fantastic recording of British players with a few New Orleans icons. The Brits have mastered the idiom and the music flows with grace, ease, and an unhurried swing that makes it immediately accessible and ingratiating. De De Pierce plays a masterful lead trumpet and Billie sounds earthy and fine on piano and vocals. Paul Barbarin drives the music along with his unique old time drumming. It's taken from an outdoor patio performance in the French quarter and the  sound is good. With stellar contributions from many of the Brits, names you may be familiar with, this is one to savour.
Recorded over 20 years ago, this music is as fresh and interesting as the day it was recorded.  That violin, bass and guitar (or mandolin, or soprano guitar) could sound as harmonious, as varied even orchestral as they do  here, is a tribute to the writing and musical skill of these fine  musicians. Central to the trio is the bass of Mr Linberg, whose rich woody  sound as a walking bass, or as the dark arco sound when he bows it, or when  it is strummed flamenco like, is a real thing of beauty, it sounds  beautiful, rich and beautiful. It is of course complemented by the witty,  swinging work of Mr Bang whose striking facility on the violin never fails  to appeal.  Mr Emery's range of sounds using the mandolin not to mention  the the guitars, is as sweet and interesting as one could imagine. Each  musician contributes one composition beginning with Mr Lindberg's ambitious  and wholly successful East Side Suite (20min) followed by Mr Bang (a witty  conversational work) and Catharsis in Real Time by Mr Emery (an  experimental soundscape). This is music one can live and I suspect return  to with pleasure over a very long time indeed, so well executed, so well  recorded, so varied are its pleasures.
Here are 3 late Haydn Symphonies  by Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic on DGG.  Recorded in Musikverein in 1983, 1984, 1985.  I was still a young &#34;music Student, &#34; when I read and heard from classical radio's announcers that Bernstein's Haydn was alwaYS RATHER GOOD.  IO NEVER WOULD OF GUESSED, AND EVEN MY TEACHE, MY &#34;FAMILY PRIEST, UNCLE TOM SAID THE SAME THING.  SO, I THOUGHT I'D GIVE HOM A TRY, but, I put it off for a few yerars,-----A FEW years??  More like 30 or more years, as I guess I was still skeptical since I viewed Bernstein and still do as a strutting egoistwitrh never enough publicity about himself.  He waS A VERY TALENTED, TRUE, BUT AL;SO AN EXCESSIVE one man show.  CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN ABILITIES HE WAS, AND THAT IS FINE, BUT, ENOUGH ALREADY.  WELL, GOD RESTR HIS SOUL, AND THANKS FOR THE HUGE GIFTS OF MUSIC TO AMERICA AND THE WORLD.  HIS FATHER FAMOUSLY ONCE SAID, I NEVER THOUGHT THAT LEONARD BERFNSTEIN WOULD BECOME leonARD BERNSTEIN !!&#34;  NEITHER DIOD WE.  SO NOW FOR THE MUSIC.THE SYMPHONY IN G, #88 IS THE LEADOFF PIECE ON THIS DGG DISK AND JUMPS RIGFHT OFF THE PAZGES IN ROLLICKING HYDN FASHIOn, and opens with the customary Adagio intro then the Allegro follopwed by the Largo, a menuetto and wrapping it up with a spiited Allegro.  It lastsx a mere 24:28 and is just too short, leaving us hungry for more.  The first time I heard it was in a SXanJose Symphony concert with the Prokovief 1st Symphony and the Schubert 9th.  A grand and inttelligent program demonstrazting the preogression of the symphony, even though the Prokofiev was a bit of a gimmicky work, and not really &#34;Classical&#34; in it's natutre, ,but delightful just the same.  I like it instantly, as did the audience and I swore that , before I got too old, I would learn many more of this Austrian Master's works.  Just the thought of all those terrific works ahead of me makes the long, grey winter in NE Washingtion seem less bleak and az tad warmer, in my heart, at least.  I hgope I can report next Spring that I have learned several Symphonmies moe than IO know today.  No excuse, just some planned work ahead for me.  The 2nd movement is sa lovely slow Largo with Bernstein at his elegant bestgiving us the noble and stately tempo this wonderful movement deserves.  A graceful Menuetto follows at a triming of 4:24 and with every one of them I learn, I can now see what my Uncle Tom did in his seminary days and late years.  What a wonderful composer and gentleman.  By the way, Uncle Tom had a thing about Mahler and Bruckner as well. These two geneouses, were also high on his list of favorites, so it was not Just Haydn, Mozat and Beethoven, butr thst trio was certainly zat the heart of  his library, and it took me a long timed to really undersatand that fact.  So, my question became, &#34;where has Haydn been all my life?&#34;  ahden it should of beden &#34;Why have n I been wasting my timed with so much lesser music?  Ah, the foolishness of youth, but also thed thrill of discovery.  So, I wil;l try to be more diligent this coming SWinter and early Spring and really make some progress.  EWish me luck!The newxt work is the terrific Symphony in G, #92, the &#34;Oxford,&#34; anoither typical Haydn masterwork of energy and spleandor, it runs a mere 27:57 under Bernstein's livelyt direction.  Yet another Adagio intro, sedzate and calm, it erupts into a splash of sound at the )1:28 point,  with a very humable tune that is a breikkiant asx it is catchy.  The sweet glee of Haydn enchants all  and Berstein makes sure we get all that the composer has to offer, and then some.  How can one man produce so many different utterly delightful themes, all different in some detaqil and not appear redundant?  A geneous is trhe correcxt answer. An endless font of invention, all different in some detail?  But, Haydn was only a man, ,a great composer, true but nothing about him other than his clearly superiior behavior and manners, he was yet another almost aristocratic personality, who was a welcome guest everywhere and the toast of every musical capital on the continent.  The news of a new Haydn symphony was never taken lightly but was a sourse of excitement and anticipation by the educated elite, which over time aznd Haydn's lifetime, mbecame the schooled masses.  As we moved into the very early 19th Century,, more and more of European men, AND WOMEN LEARNEWD MORE THAT SIMPLY THEIR A,B,C'S but the news of the world,, a world changing in dramatic ways and with the dawn of the industrial and technological Revolutions, the man-in-the-streets became more enlightenedthat even his older brother, not to speak of his parents.  Litercy rates rose, premature deaths from simple diseases, we now scoff at, were decreasing and, perhasps most enticingly was the idea that there waS BEGINING IN EUROPE, the beginings of a shared and continental culture, alive with literature, music, science and technology, although there would be the problem of Napoleon and the wave of revolutions to deal with, the more affluent class started talking about the thrill of &#34;progress&#34;, as characters in Geroge Eliot's &#34;Middlemarch&#34; a sprawlinmg novel of romance , class and the early 19th Century's growing pains, were very much interested in and affected by.  My wife's favorite novel, most of it, to be honest, is a romantic yarn with lots of terribly English members of the upper sitting around sipping tea and gossiping about this or that.  Still, trhe backdrop is this developmental activity, which I think, Haydn felt through his music, or at least tried to convey.The &#34;Oxford's&#34; adagio is a 7:59 long piece bvlaanced delicately by Bernstein with micro management that works well and his transitions are smooth and convincing.  He is gentle, careful and prudent in his sturm und drang treatment vof this fragile material.  He is so much more than the thuinder and lightning he was famed for.  The public adored Bernstein's Tchaikovsky, Mahler, Dvorak.  They also loved his Berlioz, Bruch and of course, Beethoven, notably his Eroica and 5th Symphony.  In fact, anything of spectacle and pathos wedre his strengths.  That covers a lot of materialI've been more a critic than a fan of Leonard Bernstein and I often wondered how he would of conducted if the world were blind.  Think about it.  One goes to hear bruno Walter and Zubin Mehta in , say New York, but they go to SEE Bernstein and perhaps don't realize the differentiation between seeing the music and hearing it.  I adnit, I've done this a few times myself, but more to see how this or that sound is produced in a pe-recording concert, for instance.  For example, are there one or two trumpets in that long pedal point for the trumpet in the Derrick Cooke version of the Mahler 10th?  And, how can only one player hold a n ote so well for so long?  Truth is, I forgot whether it is 1 or 2 instruments, but I think ytoyu get my point.  Anyhow, this is a beautiful and touching adagio and is followed by an equally splendid Finale-Presto, of 5:41.  Like a blazing fire it flares and quickly burns itself out, but the aftermath is clearly felt by the audience and musicians alike.Perhaps the most well known of this trio of great symphonies is the Symphony in G, #94, the &#34;Surprise,&#34; with a loud forte bang in the Andante at the 00:30 mark.  Suffice it to say there are no other moments like it inal trhe repertoire and it shows Haydn aT HIS MOST CHARMING, BUT I HAVE A TINY QUIBBLE WITH IT.  THE COMPOSER SHOULD OF GIVEN US THE SURPRISE LATE IN THE MOVEMENT, TO AZLLOW HIS audience to be lulled asleep longer for a greater effect.  Still, even though I know it's coming, I still jump as Bernstein, if for just a moment is allowed to be the REAL Bernstein.  I'm sure he smiled every time he led this work, but it is so much more than simply a forte timpani stroke as the first movement is a delightful Adagio--Allegro vivace all by itself.  After the _____intro, the music again takes-off, into a rollicking and joyous tempo utterly foot tapping and brilliant.  The lightness and &eacute;lan is adducting toi the senses, and we are smiling long before the timpanist has his moment in the sun.  By this time, I once again can see, hear and feel the sheer genius of this great composer, and I really do feel foolish for not having paid more attention to him in my earlier days as the perennial student for my dear Uncle Tom.  Any good man, who dedicates his life to serving God, like a good priest, minister or Rabbi, I simply find it difficult to even, for a moment to think them not in Heaven at the present time.  If Heaven IS Heaven, then surely , for my beloved Uncle, it must mean an eternity with God, yes, but also with his brothers, parents, family and buddies and other men of his Church, but also with Haydn himself.  How could Heaven NOT be so, without that which gave him so much joy in his Earthly time?  It seems a fitting reward and I pray that, IF I make it there, I may receive a similar gift, an eternity with the music I have loved for more than /3rds of my poor miserable life here oin Earth.  A good reason to behave myself!  I wish I knew!  Anyhow the enchanting  Andante aside,, the rest of this movement is noble, stately and very memorable, as in hummable.  A short Menuetto of 5:29 leads us then into the Finale, allegro molto of only 3:46 and , again as in the previous Symphony #92, this conclusion is a flaming  and intense burn for a short time to bring  the &#34;Suprize&#34;to an incandecent  and thrilling end.I almost forgot to mention that all three of these masterpieces are in the key of G and Bernstein conducts them with the highest spirits I heard from him in some time.  I must say, that it isn't usual for me to learn this much from one of my own reviews, but I have here, so thank you all for being there to talk to.  I will secure more Bernstein Haydn npw that my curiosities have been re-awakenedand anew, and it just goes to show how much music there is and how much we all have yet to learn.  AZ wonderful prospect, this nearly endless land of discovery  and renewal.  Happy Listening and Happy New Year, everyone and God Bless allc of you.  Be careful on New Years Eved, if you go out, and please feel free to commenton my eviews good or bad--especially where I need inproving!!God Bless You and keep you and your families safe and in His loving arms,  Tony.
It seems that the Bach English Suites Nos. 2 and 3 are the only works of Bach that Ivo Pogorelich has recorded.Being a pianist with a pre-dominantly romantic repertoire, it comes a little bit unexpectant that he could come up with such a perfect performance of baroque works as well.Expecting or not, the performances of these baroque pieces are for many many years the best I have heard. Even if Angela Hewitt made a whole compilation of Bach's works, I would still hesitate to say that she could surpass Ivo in his artistry demonstrated so early on in his album.The preludes to the two suites were simply played to perfection - I cannot choose another word. The dances of the suites have the absolutely appropriate lilt, nuance, touch, musical taste and melodic lines. The contrapuntal lines are so well grasped that you would only expect from a top-notch baroque interpretor. And even top-notch interpretors may not necessarily have the ability to display the lines in such a manner as Pogorelich does. His ability to understand, to display, and to re-live the music in these works is simply stunning.Whether you are a beginner of Bach and Scarlatti, or a seasoned expert in such works, you will surely love this disc like no other.
It's great to see these recordings available again. Those who've heard the rattle trap about Ivo being brash, irreverent and unschooled ought check this out. The funny thing is that despite the fact that there are a lot of great Ivo discs, this is the best I think. In place of the overt pyrotechnics, there is a mixture of spellbinding rhythmic intensity and amazing touch. It helps that these are among Bach's most hypnotic pieces. The first movements of both of these suites are amazing, constructed of repeating figures that anticipate some of Beethoven's great constructs (like the Eroice and the Scherzo from the 9th). For those who think that Bach's rounds can be dry and academic, and Ivo brash and uncouth, meet the wonders of a happy marriage of seeming opposites.
I have the CD issue of these recordings in DG's Johannes Brahms Edition.  The current CD appears to be of the same masterings.  A DVD of these performances also offers surround sound.  Of the current CD, I can enthuse completely.  In the Violin Concerto, Gidon Kremer plays with a rhapsodic flair that almost reminds me of Heifetz.  I do not know whose cadenza he uses in the first movement; it is new to me.  In the slow movement, Bernstein and Kremer weave textures that are beautiful without ever seeming solemn.  The last movement is slightly faster than I am used to hearing, but if this does make for some awkward phrasing it is still very exciting.  The Double Concerto receives the best performance I ever have heard.  Much of the credit goes to Bernstein, who heightens the lyric element in the accompaniment without every becoming flabby or too terse.  The sound of the orchestra here is glorious.  Part of the improvement may be due to the fact that the Double Concerto was recorded in the Musikverein, while the Concerto was recorded in the Konzerthaus.  Kremer and Maisky blend like two old colleagues who have nothing to prove to one another.  There is nothing showy about their performances, unlike Rostropovich in the Szell recording.  There is a winning combination of chamber music with symphonic writing in this performance, which may have been what Brahms had in mind all along, deriving inspiration from Beethoven's Triple Concerto.  In sum, this CD offers highly desirable Brahms playing.  It is possibly the best and perhaps least controversial Brahms that Bernstein recorded in Vienna.
This is an excellent recording. The quintet itself was a new discovery for me and I was very much struck by the haunting theme embedded within it [1st movement]. It reminded me slightly of Schubert's quartets. Paul Gulda and the Hagen Quartett exhibit exquisite playing throughout in this clear and vivid recording. If you are a fan of either Schumann's compositions or chamber music as a genre it may be worthwhile to explore this issue from Deutsche Gramophone. Recommended! Total Time: [53:28]PS! This specific recording is included inSchumann: The Masterworks.
Claudio Abbado is generally not known for his playing of Hindemith, but this recording shows that such an idea should be changed.  There are few recordings of these well-known works as well played as they are here by the world's greatest orchestra lead by the world's greatest conductor, especially in such sumptuous sound. Just listen to the stunning ending of the Symphonic Metamorphoses in which every detail is clear as is the summer's sun, and you'll give special attention to this disc. It's interesting what Hindemith could do with the little pieces of Weber he was working with, and like Beethoven, he makes a great piece from minor material. The sound and playing on this disc are so good that I got up and conducted the music myself. It provided a good ti chi sort of work out we all need.
My flamenco teacher uses this CD for our warm up and cooling down exercises, but it is good for more than that. Sensuous guitar - so sexy, yet elegant. Enjoyable for not just flamenco aficionados but great for flamenco virgins as well. Perfect for that romantic evening you plan to have with your amour visiting you at home for the first time. Just you, and the candle light, and guitar....
This CD is AWESOME, still one of my favorites after many years! This music will make you want to move and jump around, I just don't get it someone let this CD collect dust?! Not at this house!
There's more to life than beat-matching.  If you find Sasha/Digweed albums boring as all hell, but you appreciate electronic music, you might like this one.  Stacey is not the worlds most technically proficient DJ.  He's more like the Jerry Garcia (on a very good day) of the turntables.  He'll mess up and work with it, rewriting while playing.  I think his stuff is brilliant and he doesn't really edit his technical miscues on this record, but uses effects and overdubs to play with them.  Stacey attempts a lot of craziness that most DJ's wouldn't touch, don't take it to seriously.  I suppose if your looking for uninterrupted beat to dance/trance to, you might be dissappointed, but give this one some time.  It's a listen piece as much as a dancing piece.  For me it was kind of like the difficulty of discovering Jimi Hendrix after being raised on Eddie Van Halen.
THIS is the complete set of Mozart piano concertos to own and treasure for a lifetime. It's fascinating to hear Mozart's considerable development through the concerto form, and becomes much more with this collection of performances by Concentus Hungaricus and the bewitchingly thoughtful playing of pianist Jeno Jando. Add to that the stellar acoustic ambience afforded throughout by gifted Naxos' engineers, and you have a compelling set indeed. I turn to these Mozart piano concerto recordings again and again. I admire Maria Joao Pires' Mozart, and Gilel's great recording of the 27th, but these recordings surpass others in constancy, beauty, and especially tempi. The vital balance between orchestra and soloist is superior here. That delicate balance is always alive, revealing and assured - completely rewarding in every way. Any single disc of these concertos will give lasting pleasure, but listening to a string of these musical wonders is a revelation. Don't hesitate for an instant to purchase the complete set at this price. Jando uses Mozart's cadenzas for the most part, and that considered choice is the right one. Without question a musician's set of Mozart concertos. The orchestra dives straight to the heart of Mozart's amazing works, and Jando masters one revealing moment after another. What could be finer? This is perfect music making. A hundred stars and a definite  recommendation. Life-sustaining music, and performances that express that where Mozart is, there is the divine art.
Easily the finest interpretation of these two works on CD, as a quick audition will reveal. Such unanimity of thought, such fresh phrasing make this an inspirational experience not to be missed. No problems with the sound at all, a very natural acoustic with a life-like string sound adding to my pleasure of this release, a favourite CD.
I got this because of the 3 sonatas.The fantasy here is fine.But the fantasy here is not as great as the wanderer for solo piano.
This is one of those great CDs you can get if you're starting your classical music collection and don't want to bust the piggybank.  But it's also worthwhile even if you already own six or eighty "more famous" Archdukes, as I do.  If this CD were a car it would be a BMW for the price of a Hyundai.  For Jando, Nishizaki and Onczay may not be household names (they may not even be pronounceable for some Americans) but they play with fire and the spark of performers fully caught up in the excitement of a live performance.This Ghost has a lot of spirit, with sharp attacks and precise control of dynamnics, as well as an expansive, singing line in the first movement's main theme.  I just couldn't stop smiling at the freshness and enthusiasm of it all--it's as though these musicians were experiencing these notes for the first time ever.  Yet they play very tightly, as thought they've been an ensemble for years.  (Compare them to recent incarnations of the Beaux Arts Trio, for example.)  Tempi are brisk, approaches are crisp (though never cold and unfeeling) and as another reviewer has noted, there are no mannerisms, no eccentricities, no dawdlings here.The Archduke benefits even more from this straightforward approach.  Often the first movement of this work is indeed too mannered.  There's a basic forward pulse that has to be dealt with and not interfered with too much, and it gets an excellent handling here.  This work is chock full of difficulties for the performers.  It's not a flashy virtuoso piece that gets the audience all worked up, but there are places where the pianist has to wrestle with the urge to speed the tempo, just because it's easier and more convenient, physically, to play it that way.  Almost everyone rushes the second theme of the second movement--and they do here too, but not nearly as much as others I've heard.  Trios can and have become totally unglued over this section.  Dynamics can also be hard to coordinate, but there are no problems in this performance.The theme and variations is Beethoven at his most unearthly sublime, preparing for the sort of cosmic slow movements that would become staples of his late string quartets, piano sonatas, and the 9th symphony.  The group gets plenty of distinct character out of each varations, and manage to anticipate the last movement's opening phrase beautifully, which is contained in the T&Vs;, just as much of the material of the second movement is found in the first movement.  The last movement explodes with a sheer joy I've rarely heard in recordings.  The coda twinkles and bubbles over (Jando really stands out here) like I've never heard before.  But as I said, that's how these three play this music--like it was written that day for the first time.  It is true they play without a lot of *individual* identity, so if you're looking for the kind of unique personalities that make up the Busch or Lindsay Quartets you won't find it here.  This is more three musicians playing to a common purpose and not trying to stand out.No matter how many recordings of these familiar works you have, make room for this CD on your shelf.  Recorded sound is bright--maybe a little too bright for my tastes, but yours may vary--but the sound is crystal clear.  Especially for the price, this is a no-brainer.
This CD of two of the three late sonatas by Schubert is excellently conveyed by Jeno Jando, who is able to capture what Schumann referred to Schubert's music as its &quot;Heavenly Length&quot;.  Not as popular as Schubert's Impromptus or Moments Musicaux, the Sonatas, in my opinion, are just as well crafted, and seem to have a symphonic nature about them.  The last sonata is played with extraordinary breadth and a sense of confidence.  And the price is unbeatable as well-You can never go wrong with Naxos.
I agree with the other review here. The arrangements/orchestrations, playing of soloist and orchestra, and recording are first-rate.Incidently, the orchestral settings were created by Gerald Garcia not Peter Breiner.
Nielsen's immortal Symphony No. 4  was written during The First World War years (1916). And Symphony No. 5 was written after the war. Because of, these symphonies tells crisis about the war. Also, about Symphony 4, according to Nielsen, &quot;Music is life&quot; and music, like life, &quot;Inextinguishable&quot;.And, I think, this recording is very succesful. Especially, in Symphony 4, solos of the two set timpani (these solos are difficult for timpanists) are very good. The woodwinds (in the 2nd movement) are very soft and nice. The quality of sound is excellent.I think, this CD can buy whitout hesitate. Highly recommended for all Nielsen fans.
Great harpsicord music of the baroque era.Rameau is frances finest composer of the baroque era.
1. Gilbert Rowland's playing was first-rate on Vol. 2 (as good as Vol. 1)2. This is the best harpsichord music recording I've heard in quite awhile. (This quality level equals that of Vol. 1)3. The price ($6/US) was a bonus! (same as Vol. 1)I rate this five stars!
I have really enjoyed this recording. In addition to the usual it's-a-Rubsam-and-Naxos-recording-so-it's-good stuff, the sound on this one is incredibly clear and has wonderful depth. The playing is also very precise and clean. This sounds really good in a large stereo system. Highly recommend.
If you love harpsichord music you'll love this. Cummings is a really fine musician.  Amazon is such a great resource for music.couldn't do without it.
This budget-priced recording of harpsichord music by the seventeenth century French composer Francois Couperin (1668 -- 1733) is an outstanding introduction to some little-known music of the French baroque.  The performance by harpsichordist Lawrence Cummings, recorded in 1994, has received great critical acclaim.  I am pleased that the CD is still getting attention with two recent and justly enthusiastic reviews on this site.Francois Couperin's harpsichord music departs from that of his predecessors in several ways.  While earlier French composers wrote primarily dance pieces, Couperin shifted the focus to short character or genre pieces depicting a specific person, scene or emotion.  In addition, the music of earlier French composers for the harpsichord was highly improvisatory, in a form called style brise, derived from music for the lute.  It frequently does not use bar lines, relying on the imagination and improvisatory skill of the performer.  Francois Couperin changed that by writing out his scores in great detail and in insisting upon a faithful, exact performance of what he wrote.The eminent scholar of the French baroque period, James Anthony, has aptly described Couperin's harpsichord music as "so elusive, yet so compelling."  He wrote:"[I]n the company of some of Chopin's Mazurkas and Debussy's Preludes, much of Couperin's keyboard music is more a communication between instrument and performer in the intimacy of his music-room than it is between performer on the stage and an unseen audience.  It reveals itself only gradually and only after repeated playings.  It is wed to its instrument as is no other music."Couperin's extensive output for the harpsichord is gathered into four large books each of which is subdivided into a section called an "ordre".  On this CD, Cummings performs the first ordre of Book One, composed in 1713, consisting of 18 pieces.The first five pieces are in traditional dance form, but even here Couperin imparts a special character to his miniatures.  Thus, the opening Allemande is meant as a portrayal of and high compliment to the Duke of Maine, while the sarabande(no 4), titled "la Magisteuse" is a portrait of Louis XIV in his glory.The remaining works in the first ordre are all character pieces, many of which derive from vocal music.  Some of them are humorous as in "Les Nonetes" portraying a pair of none-too-chaste nuns and "La Bourbonaise", a portrayal of a highly flirtatous and independent woman.  Other pieces, such as "Les Sentiments" are highly reflective and melancholy while still others such as "L'Enchantress", "La Pastorale", and "Les Plasirs de Saint Germain en Laye" have the grace and ease of a painting by Watteau.  There is much to enjoy here.The CD concludes with the first and second concerts from Couperin's series "Concerts Royaux".  Couperin composed these works for performances at Louis XIV's Sunday musical soirees. They are scored for performance by solo harpsichord or by ensembles. They are performed by Cummings here, with viol and viola da gamba, respectively, added to the final work of each set.  These two concert suites return to the use of traditional dance forms.  But they are notable because they show Couperin absorbing the style of the Italian baroque into his work.  In particular, the second concert includes an "Allemande fugate" and an "air contrefuge" which adopt a fugal style of writing derived from Corelli, a great favorite of Francois Couperin.This CD will appeal to lovers of the harpsichord and to those listeners who want to explore the beauties of early music.The quotations in this review are taken from Jamer R. Anthony, "French Baroque Music" revised edition p. 259.Robin Friedman
I am happy with this CD.  I wanted to get the four-hand piano version of the Brahms Hungarian Dances without paying too much for them.  This CD was just right for me.  The Hungarian Dances, as well as the Liebeslieder Waltzes, are played with plenty of energy.  The sound (recorded 1995) is very good.  I have greatly enjoyed this CD , and I highly recommend it to those interested in the Brahms Hungarian Dances.
An excellent sampler of Dowland's repertoire. The Rose Consort of Viols plays wonderfully and are well supported by a warm and immediate recording. I have spent many hours enjoying this album. Naxos strikes gold once again. Highly recommended!
What can I say? I love harpsichord music and the compositions by Soler. These chromatic sounds thrill the senses! Try his organ pieces as well.  I own quite a few CD by this composer; some quieter pieces and some firey ones. It's all good!
If you bought this recording, you probably have heard most of the music and want it available whenever the thought strikes you, right?  Or it might have been that sample song that came with your computer and you decided to investigate more music in that vein.  Either way, this CD is beautifully recorded music that stays with you after listening...you will come back to listen again and again...  ENJOY!  (o:
This CD and its pair (vol. 2 - a recommended CD!) are perhaps everything that it means to be a CD of early music for the transverse flute. The somewhat outdated sound of the harpsichord with the breathy aspect of the flute may no longer be the style, however it is still beautiful.It takes some level of appreciation to enjoy Hotteterre's music as played on the transverse flute. Hotteterre composed beautiful music for the flute, perhaps some of the nicest of the time. His compositions have beautiful moments, exciting moments... everything good music needs.However, the typical style is one that can occasionally be obtrusive or simply annoying. If you don't really love the transverse flute and its buddies, perhaps this isn't the disc for you. While it is a CD of fun and lovely music, well played and presented well, it may not be for everyone.Recommended for transverse flute fans, for anyone looking for something pretty and old, or simply just a music fan who really wants something new and very good. It's a great CD, but perhaps it's not for everyone.
Two very melodious, enchanting piano concertos. The first one is a complete delight, with two sprightly and vibrant allegros, and a lyric pastoral Scottish air.  The rondo polonaise-arpeggio movement of concerto 3 is especially enjoyable and marvelous !
great and i hope we will hear more of it. unbeatable, precise and warm playing. Excellent feeling for articulation and phrasing.
I bought the CD looking for that great Estudantina Waltz.  Beside that  work  I got wonderful performances I also got excellent similar works in clear full sound.  Highly recommended.
With selections from several Bach recordings, Naxos has produced a very satisfying and nicely recorded sampler of Bach keyboard pieces. I especially enjoyed Janos Sebestyen's reading of the Italian Concerto in F Major. I also highly recommend his recording of the 2/3 Part InventionsBach: Inventions and Sinfonias (Complete).
One feels the powerful sonority of a huge cathedral in this recording.  This is a long-time favorite, whose CD was damaged.
You must first be aware that this document is historical. The rating is not based on audiophile criteria, but content and diversity. You have to listen through some noise in the early recordings. See the review which lists materials to find the familiar. Be prepared to explore works of Wilhelm Stenhammar, Hugo Alfven,Gosta Nystroem, Hilding Rosenberg,Franz Berwald, and others. You will find Orff, Hindemith,Kodaly and others as well.Much, not all, of the documentation is in both Swedish and English.Great diversity may be experienced by the patient listener.This is most assuredly NOT a casual cd box of great classics for background and easy listening. One who is curious about the development of a symphony orchestra between 1914 and 1989 will have hours of learning.
Slavonic Dances is a 1998 Grammophon AB BIS recording under the direction of Leif Segerstam who leads the Sattsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pzalz. Mark Hutchinson has writte then music notes and it also includes a short biography of the conductor. Highly recommended. 5/5.
Bach: Complete Organ Music, Vol.9 is a recording with the famous organist Hans Fagius who plays the organ music of Bach on a reconstructed Wahlberg Organ from 1764 in Fredrickskyrkan, Karlskrona in Sweden. It was recorded by BIS Records Ab in 1994. Hans Fagius has written the liner-notes which are very well-written and very interesting. Bach is considered to be the master of organ music and listening to this recording it is easy to understand why. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
"Wow" is all I can say after listening to this CD.  Christian Lindberg is an extraordinary Trombonist!  This CD truly shows off his strikingly pure tone and magnificent musicianship.  I highly recommend this CD!  It's simply amazing!
This is dense.  Very very dense.  I like to listen to it with the lights low at night on a very powerful stereo.  To hell with the neighbors.Beware the 10th movement "The resurection of Christ".  Messaien loves to prolong the resolution of dissonance into consonance.  He does so with EXTREME mastery on this movement.  He builds the anticipation to such a high degree that by the end of this movement you will be dizzy and salivating, begging him to release you... and he wont... until... the magnificent, almost orgasmic final chord.  I have personally passed out after listening to this piece due to hyper-ventillation!  It is the most beautiful thing Ive ever heard since Barber's Adagio for Strings.This is not for the uninitiated.  Do not play it for your girlfriend, that is unless she likes dense and intense music.  In which case watch out cause I may steal her from you.  If you are a girl... how YOU doin'?  (wink wink :)
Trombone may not seem to be the ideal instrument to go with an operatic soloist, but Lindberg is playing an alto trombone, a diminutive cousin to the tenor version played in today's ensembles.  It sounds like a cross between a bass trumpet and a french horn, and he plays it with great virtuosity. Ms Groop is a very fine singer (and anyway, I've always been a sucker for Mezzos); and their string and organ accompaniment is quite tight and well balanced.Look, I'll skip the filler nonsense: you will not find a finer chamber group anywhere.  If you like soothing, well played baroque/classical chamber music, you will not be sorry you got this album.
This cd has some obscure but excellent pieces on it, particularly the "Okna (Windows)" by Petr Eben. The better known "Prayer of St. Gregory" and Persichetti's "The Hollow Men" are good recordings, and the other pieces are also played well. The last track, Lowry's "Suburban Measures" is quite abstract, but interesting. My only complaint would be that the recorded sound seems distant and makes the trumpet less clear than it should be.
It would take some doing to turn me away from my Kim Kashkashian recording of the Hindemith viola works, but if any disc can come close, it would probably be have to be this one.  Though I love Kashkashian's precise, sensitive interpretations of Hindemith, I often feel that the piano part simply doesn't get the aural prominence it deserves.  But on this Imai/P&ouml;ntinen disc, most notably in the fiery finale of Op. 25 No. 4, the piano is thrillingly, vividly present.  In fact, comparing them now, the whole of the acoustic seems much more alive...  Though on the whole, I must prefer the alert tempi and smooth, handsome facility the Kashkashian performances, I am certainly glad I to fall back on this disc for perhaps a slightly edgier, more &quot;live&quot; rendition.
I agree with Karl, but I find the Piano Concerto one of the most rewarding of the 20th Century.  Yes, it is superficially simple, but the way Sumera expands on the quirky little theme that opens the work is masterly.  Momentum and passion build in the last (2nd) movement in a way that just carries me away.Symphony 4 and M. Tenera are also very fine, and there is outstanding sound.I agree with Karl that Bis 660 (Syms 1-3) is the place to start with Sumera; if you are moved by them, you owe it to yourself to try this one.
Now, THIS is the way I remember "Little Esther". This a REALLY FUN CD; I listened to it over and over, just like being a little kid again with a new album you want to really burn into your brain. BUY IT NOW.
This is a great religious cd! It is extremely to finda great condition cd anymore, of our older music!!When it comes to Gospel, these are the best!!
I love Del Reeves. I know him personaly, my father and Del served in the Air Force together. I really like his music,He sings as down to earth as he really is, So keep up the good work.  Clea's  Daughter  Donna
[...]I am pleased to find your comment on Amazon.com for Patti Page's "The Uncollected Patti Page (1949): Patti Page With Lou Stein's Music".I like her "jazz-flavored" and "blues-type" works early 50's or before.But, in these days I regrettably know that her works are mostly considered in her home country as pop and novelty music except "Tennessee Waltz".I have thought that the US Americans forgot her great voices yet. Less noteworthy than what she deserves to.And today, I have found your review to make me happy to share my opinion with someone else, which might be rarely understood and approved.I hope you may say loudly in your country about valuable achievement of her masterpieces 50 years or so ago.I expect your country may honor her with enrolling in the Jazz Hall of Fame. Because I think she is the last person who knows the Jazz Age in your country, and even Billy Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, or Sarah Vaughn through her eyes and ears as a career singer, she sholud have deserved to it. Don't you think so? Or, is she a country-flavored pop singer after all?I now enjoy collecting her early LPs.[...]
This release by David T. Chastain is a true polished diamond, pure 80's instrumental metal genius. Few guys could play like him back then, this is no radio friendly music, this is true metal. Do your self a favor and buy it.
At last, the collection returns to Cavaille-Coll, the famous organ at St. Sulpice. This in itself raises the quality of the recording a whole notch - there is NOTHING like the sonoroties of one those incredible instruments with their coloring and vast range of expression.Guilmant was in his muscial prime at this point. The fifth sonata dates from 1894, the sixth from 1896. They are still in the "old" style but are looking more toward Rheinberger, composer of twenty brilliant organ sontatas, than Bach.  He never broke from his conservativism into the chromatic language of Widor or especially Vierne but compared to the first Sonata these are advanced pieces.The fifth is a favorite - Guilmant is pushing the boundaries of the tripart classical sonata structure with a five-movement composition, the odd numbers outstanding. The sixth returns to the classical format and even contains a fugue which Widor and Vierne eventually abandoned.  It's opening movement (Allegro con fuoco) is impressive in its intensity, unity and sheer bravura.Given the secularity of modern France, one forgets that these  composers practiced a muscular Catholicism that affected each of them deeply. They were church organists and much of their output is liturgical.  The Grand Choir (G Minor) can only be called magisterial, especially on this instrument.  It is marked appropriately Allegro Moderato e maestoso and sounds every bit as impressive as its marking.  A chorale, "Was Gott thut, das ist wohlgethan", extremely impressive, concludes the recording.
And even if you do, it still might not be to your taste.Just the right parts of my brain are broken in just the right ways for me to find Neil Hamburger's "America's Funnyman" hilarious.One thing that cracks me up about it is how some of the tracks will be called, say, "O.J. Simpson" so it looks like there's gonna be a track worth of jokes about O.J. but then the track is like, less than a second long and it's just Neil saying "O.J. Simpson"---there's no joke there. It's a cheap attempt to make it look like OMG THERE'S LIKE, 45 TRACKS ON THIS ALBUM, THAT'S A LOT OF JOKES!He OPENS with a moment of silence for George Burns and it goes downhill from there. The best part of all of it to me is at the end when he finally confronts one of his many, many hecklers (people are pretty much yelling at him to SHUT UP through the whole thing).If you really think you'll appreciate this album I highly recommend actually buying the CD vs. the downloads because the inept, typo-ridden liner notes are almost as funny as the CD itself and some of the tracks are so short that the iPod and a lot of other .mp3 players might have trouble playing them.
This is a fine record.  Recording performances and the music itself are excellent.  Tailleferre has become a favourite composer of mine and her music is ideal for repeated listening on gramophone record.  Much of this music isn't published yet in France but it often sounds like it should be famous.  Her works are short, light but deep, gripping and substantial.  This is an immaculate record of some great French music.
I picked up Wavelength Infinity because it had tracks from Sonic Youth and the Residents (or at least members there of) not knowing who Sun Ra was, and not even having much appreciation or understanding of jazz. I was dissapointed in the "noise" that I heard when I first listened, and this double disc sat in the back neglected for awhile. John Coltrain, Charles Mingus, and Theloneous Monk taught me how hear Sun Ra, and I began collecting his recordings, and it grew on me. Now I go back to Wavelength and WOW, this set is amazing! A decade later fermented these "sour grapes" into sweet wine.
A tragically overlooked record, John Patton's "Minor Swing" is part of the rebirth soul jazz organist John Patton experienced in the mid '90s.  Best known for his Blue Note catalog of the '60s, these later records, on small labels like Japanese DIW, are easy to overlook, but this gem is one that's noteworthy for the involvement of both the leader and of avant-garde legend John Zorn, appearing here as a sideman alongside one of his heroes.  As a fan of both, this is one I reach for constantly-- it's not going to be the kind of thing everyone likes, particularly amongst Blue Note fans who may be put off by Zorn's on occasion abrasive playing (and here he's pretty straight for him), but for those of us who love a record that explores by looking backwards, this one is essential.Recorded by a quartet of Zorn on alto sax, Patton on organ, Ed Cherry on guitar and Zorn-associate Kenny Wollesen behind the drum kit, Patton classic and opener "The Way I Feel" pretty much sets the stage for this.  Patton, Cherry and Wollesen slink into a deep funk groove, Zorn reverently states the theme over the top.  Patton's brief solo is full of restraint before turning over to Zorn who starts inside and then explodes, introducing skronk and energy as he's prodded ever so gently by Patton's groove.  After a brief and somewhat frantic solo by Cherry, the theme comes back in, again with Zorn just eating up alive.  It's clear that he's in love with both what he's playing and the opportunity to play it with the composer.  And after this opening 12 minute track, I'm betting you'll have fallen in love yourself or turned it off.The record pretty much continues in this fashion, working through a bunch of Patton's compositions-- Zorn actually stays a bit further inside then he does on the extended opener, but the method doesn't really change-- reverent theme statements, some fantastic soloing, and a bunch of lockstep deep grooves.Really, it's a shame that this record and its contemporaries are so hard to find.  For fans of John Patton, this rennaissance is something to be explored and for Zorn fans, there are so few opportunities to hear him either blowing as a sideman or playing someone else's work without having stuck his own stamp all over it.  From either perspective, "Minor Swing" is an essential and critical recording.  Highly recommended.
Most jazz fans know about tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton' great albums on the Concord label, both as a leader and as an accompanist for Rosemary Clooney and other singers.  This Progressive CD from producer Gus Statiras gives some fine examples of the early Scott with 10 tunes recorded in 1978.  Alternating Hank Jones and Tommy Flanagan on the piano and with George Mraz on bass and Connie Kay on drums, the album swings on the likes of &quot;You'd Be So Nice to Come Home to&quot; but also chills out for some mellow ballads like &quot;Body and Soul.&quot;  If you like a well-played tenor sax or your other CDs by Scott Hamilton, this rarely seen effort is a must for your collection.
Easily the best recording of Strayhorn tunes by anyone other than Strayhorn. Harry Allen's tenor playing is sumptuous! Keith Ingham is a wonderfully inventive pianist/arranger. The sound quality on both volumes is superb. The woody tone of the stand up bass is captured remarkably well.Harry Allen's solo career has taken off in recent years. He's an in demand tenor, playing gigs and making records around the world. These recordings, from his early days, are excellent examples of his-even then-spectacular playing. Both volumes offer exquisite musical interpretations from the Strayhorn songbook and should not be missed.
I have the Four Seasons on vinyl and wanted it on a CD to play while at the computer; hence my order.  It is exactly the same as the record (artists and conductor) with several more selection.  So glad to now have it in this format.
One of Michelangeli's supreme recordings! The Images books sublimely wrought, a pianist of excruciating gifts with his mystifying inner world fully alive, and  beautifully intimate sonics that are a model of restraint. What more can you ask for? Find me another recorded version of the Images to rival this one. Michelangeli gives us Debussy in gestures so natural as to be invisible. His Children's Corner is pure magic, profound, completely free; he proposes Debussy's as an art of revolutionary depth. Michelangeli's unerring conception is transparent and scintillating, richer than it appears, and ripe with truth. This is absolutely magisterial musical art in the throes of genius and high purpose. Discover the art of the gods. Overwhelming recommendation for a perfect recording.
I have enjoyed this recording.  The luscious sound of this recording, in spite of being made decades ago, can really grab your attention.  Not much today can compare.
This is one hell of keyboard playing. Pogorelich brings all his unrivaled training in classical pianism afforded only to players of the modern grand piano and marries it successfully with astonishing clarity appropriate to the musical conception of Haydn. You ought to hear what this man's pinky finger alone is capable of. There is a footage of his recital in Japan in the early 80s playing the A flat major Sonata online that can be easily accessed. His keyboard color is infinitesimally shaded; the separation of lines between his right and left hand is made clear as an azure sky on a summer day. The chords are perfectly balanced, and when Pogorelich decides to crescendo, he does so tastefully (you won't hear the same kind of fortissimo displayed in his Chopin preludes), and with total control. As a matter of fact, Pogorelich's rendition of the presto finale of A Flat Major Sonata is my favorite piano track in my entire musical collection.If you've enjoyed Pogorelich's Scarlatti album, this album is certainly for you! I think Pogorelich shares Vladimir Horowitz's comment regarding just how much pianism one should utilize when playing Scarlatti on a modern concert grand: not too much, but imaginatively. Here is a CD where imagination and technique are united harmoniously. His pearly runs and exquisite phrasings are second to none among living pianists. I'd love to be proven wrong, but it's a tall order to fulfill. Enjoy!
After a revelatory experience with the DG recording of Beethoven's two Op. 5 Cello Sonatas by Mischa Maisky and Martha Argerich, I was compelled to buy the second disc they made which features the Op. 69 A major sonata and the two Op. 102 sonatas.  This disc is excellent in every respect.The op. 69 sonata is probably my favorite cello sonata outside of the Debussy sonata, with a warm, inspiring opening allegro and a syncopated scherzo following.  Just a beautiful work, it dates from 1808, in the later stages of the composer's "middle" period.  Beethoven went through a combined personal and artistic crisis in the early 1810s and his work slowed down.  He experienced a shattering romantic disappointment and emerged from the deep, ensuing depression in 1813, 1814 and 1815 by writing several bombastic, popular and financial renumerative pieces which are less esteemed than most of his other music.  The Op. 102 sonatas mark his return to a more personal, subtle style, and I'd describe them as difficult, at times eccentric music.  In particular, I've always found the Op. 102 no. 2 sonata in C to be maybe the strangest work from Beethoven's pen, based on the old (and very good) Pablo Casals recording.  Maisky and Argerich actually smooth out this last sonata and their performance flows more than the Casals.  The disc also contains a set of variations on a Handel theme.The two performers turn in a truly excellent rendition.  I'd describe it as unconstrained, very musical and just plain exciting.  The recording sonics, like the disc with the Op. 5 sonatas, are first class.  In sum, consistently all-around excellence.
Bach is Bach but Miasky is the one I want playing these suites. I owned these years ago and my son ended up with them.  I was delighted to see they were still available so I could repurchase.
Richard Hagopian is a fantastic ud player!  When many of today's players are seeking to due jazz fusions and other cross-cultural experiments, Hagopian has kept true to his cultural roots.  Its also nice to have an  album of Armenian ud music, considering that most folks think that all ud  players come from places like Lebanon, Iraq or Syria.  Armenia has a style  of music all there own, and shouldn't be lumped in with all other countries  from that part of the world.  Not only does Hagopian masterfully play  songs, taksims and other musical forms well on the ud, he also has a superb  voice.  This album contains songs by such Armenian legends as Hrant  Kenkulian and Kemani Tateyos Eskerjian as well as traditional dances, songs  and taksims.  Richard Hagopian is also joined by his son, Harold Hagopian  (violin, kanun) and Hagop Jack Zarzatian (dumbeg, def).  These recordings  are important documents of traditional Armenian music considering how many  Armenians have been displaced from their homeland by war, genocide and  other such atrocities.  These types of things often greatly impact a  culture, and its wondeful to see Hagopian (the elder and younger) helping  to preserve this beautiful tradition.
Please! I beg you, fellow music-lovers--don't be put off by the audiophiles and their predilection for pristine recordings. Get this CD! The performance is electric, from the very first chord to the klezmer band interpretation of the slow movement to the sweeping vistas that Klemperer does so well. It's the perfect antidote for anyone who is longing for some relief from the usual packaged--oops! Sorry. Can't use that word.
William Kapell was a major force within the North American pianism. Kapell conveyed plenty of drive and power in both concertos. He always how to blend muscular athleticism and refined poetry, always showing unkonw facets of each score he played.The Brahms is played with efervescent lyricism, powerful sense of drama and above all remarking with steeled fingering and winged melodic tune charm, nuance and harmony without lacking introspection. Mitropoulos at the podium and the NYP are additional factors that allow me to state we are in front of one of the most extraordinary versions of this superb concerto ever made.On the other hand, Stokowski adds Prokoviev, a burst of untamed energy. Kapell felt himself as a true lion in its element. Fierceness, elusive lyricism, brilliant fingering, sumptuous phrasing, enigmatic flair and wild vitality.And although my favorite version remains that of Samson Francois, you may include this version, John Browning, Michael Ponti and Gary Graffman as the hard five unsurpassed performances in this colossal and vibrant Piano concerto.Don't miss under any pretext, this historical album. A must-have.
In this first volume of his two volume collection of Brahms' piano music, Antonin Kubalek offers a survey of the composer's music that ranges from an early work -- the Piano Sonata no. 3 -- to his late period -- the three Intermezzi op. 117.  With a program like this, a pianist might be tempted to try to play in such a way as to highlight the differences between the early and later works in order to convey how the composer has grown and developed, but the effect in Kubalek's hands is rather the other way around.The Piano Sonata no. 3 is arguably one of Brahms' greatest works and it is the primary work on this recording.  It is a bold, youthful and daring work, but it also contains feelings that characterize most of Brahms' music -- longing, yearning, tenderness, poignancy as well as swagger and festive joy.  Sometimes pianists can get carried away with the youthful optimism of the piece and can play with a restricted emotional range, focusing mostly on the boldness and daring of the young Brahms.  Such recordings have only limited appeal.  Kubalek takes a different approach.  He offers us a performance of Brahms' early sonata informed by an understanding of Brahms born of his later works.  You can hear it right from the opening of the first movement.  Kubalek's opening salvo is bold but not brash.  Or listen to the lilting rhythms in the Zigeunerweisen-like Scherzo movement, or the yearning rubato of the Finale movement -- they all convey the feeling of an older Brahms looking back nostalgically at the work of his youth.  As a result, we are treated to a retrospective view of Brahms' early work that highlights what has made all his music so timeless.  By the time we reach the end of the CD -- the beautifully played Op. 117 Intermezzi -- we realize that we have been here before, right from the beginning.Kubalek's offering is among my favorite recordings of the Brahms Piano Sonata no. 3.  Other favorite performances include those of Clifford Curzon and Radu Lupu.  Additionally, Kubalek's second volume has some of the finest renditions of Brahms' late piano works.  I recommend both this disc and its companion volume unreservedly.
As Ian Levine,s Number One Fan and collector obssesed with all things produced by the great man himself I feel better qualified than most to talk about his productions. I do, after all, have the largest collection of Ian,s work starting with his days of writing and producing for [...] High Energy label Record Shack records through to his own Nightmare label and then Motorcity records. All of these items as well as all the productions he worked on that were released on American labels like AVI. By the time Motorcity Records was in full swing I was already a young record collector who had gone from buying most of the disco records that were around at that time to only buying records with Ian,s name on the credits!! This is how I,ve managed to amass such a collection that I still have today!! Any of you who are now thinking of starting to collect his work will have extreme difficulty as any items on Nightmare, Record Shack or Motorcity are extremely rare!!! Ian had always had a dream that one day he would set about tracking down as many of the former artists that made up the early hey days of Tamla Motown as he could and returning them to the recording studio, where, under his expert knowledge and guidance he would give them brand new material to perform as well as the odd revamp of some of their former classics. During the time that Motorcity records was running I was in record buying ecstacy!! There has never been a period in my life when I have enjoyed the sheer pleasure of purchasing vinyl as when Motorcity was doing its thing!!  I had no idea at the time that Ian was having to put up with all the [...] bashing and sheer nastiness that I now know was being aimed squarely at him by the old age pensioners society otherwise known as the laughable Northern Soul fraternity. Thank God I live for music and not  those freaks! Ian had great difficulty with many of the former motowners as many of them had been left dumped like sacks of rubbish by Motown owner Berry Gordy. Some were suffering from mental illness others were just elderly! But Ian breathed new life into many and gave them, what, in many cases would be their very last chance to live, as a performer so badly needs to do! Motorcity was largely funded by Ian himself and so like any self run venture it ran into severe financial problems. Show me any business venture that demonstrates true courage and originality that has,nt had severe financial problems at some stage! But through it all I was chasing around buying up anything with Motorcity on it! The Marvelettes are a good example of how one man,s genius reserected a group who were dead and gone and reinvented them for future generations to love and enjoy, and this is the gift that Ian Levine has given us!! If you can find this album, BUY IT!
The above poster is obviously NOT a dance music head, if he only recognized 2 songs!!! You gotta be kidding me!!!
Thanks Amazon for making great classic 70's music like this available to your customers. I also grew up in the City of Youngstown,Ohio with members of this group. Some fantastic Talent came out of Youngstown in that era. Sweet Thunder released Three albums 1.Above the clouds 2.Sweet Thunder 3. Horizons  Anyone interested in the albums not available on Amazon can go to Music Stack.Com  they sell all three albums on LP and CD.
I like Mike better than his brother Fred.  His symphonies are lively and entertaining.
Carl Reinecke belongs a dynasty of the Great German Romantic tradition. His role as conductor of the famed Gewandhaus Orchestra between 1860 and 1895 talks by itself about the artistic relevance of this talented musician who composed 288 Opus. The most significant personalities of the keyboard in those ages were apart of the three colossus Wagner, Liszt (the new sounds) and Brahms (embodying the classic German tradition) Felix Mendlessohn, Robert Schumann, Adolf von Henselt, Charles Valentin Alkan,  Hans von Bronsart, Ignaz Moscheles, Carl Tausig, Philp Sharwenka, and the flashing and thundering Sigismund Thalberg. Note I just have encircled a narrow but relevant number without naming celebrities of sonorous figuration such Anton Rubinstein, Gabriel Faure, Edward Lalo.The major musical influence received for Reinecke comes from Mendelssohn and Schumann. Nevertheless his vigorous inspiration and the acute employment of orchestration, deserves him special consideration at the time to remark one of his most visible virtues. You can realize the display and fruitful musical exchange between the soloist instrument and orchestra.The most known of his Concertos was the Third; ambitious and extremely expressive, signed by an enrooted Pastoral character, with several contemplative passages, loaded with slender moments and lyric imagination, the cadenza in the First Movement is filled of inspiration and enjoyment. However, the First Concerto at first sight seems to engage with major easiness the great audiences, according the increasing offer of versions in the market. It is more austere and straightforward than the Third, but shines with particular intensity.Gerard Robbins reached in 1973 a resonant triumph with the release of the Concertos 1 and 2, a curious fact that linked with a notable performance of Michael Ponti of the First that attracted the attention of new audiences in search of new repertoires.This is a magnificent opportunity and maybe the only one to have the whole set of Concertos of this remarkable conductor and minor composer who would deserve a major dedication and concern for public and musicians. Klaus Helwig plays with  broad musical solvency, great emotional involvement, and passionate inspiration. The Orchestra is discrete but makes the best they can; remarkable conduction of Alun Francis.
This album is really good, but i think it would work better for you if you had at leats a minimal idea who Adorno was. What i mean is, off course you can enjoy the music without any extra info, but knowing that Adorno was a pupil of Alban Berg, and the fact that he was into the Schoenberg musical composing school helps you a lot to understand this work. Very interesting and original dodecaphonic music.
It is a well-known adage that if you lived in the eighteenth century and said "Bach", you meant not Johann Sebastian but his second son Carl Philipp Emanuel (1714 - 1788), whose long career at the royal Prussian court in Berlin and then as successor to Telemann in Hamburg, but also, of course, his not inconsiderable musical productivity destined him to be one of the most famous musicians of his age. Today, his life and work stand very much in the shadow of his father, but the period instrument revival of the last 40 years has begun to restore him to favour, at least in the eyes of those who have time for music before Mozart.Emanuel Bach wrote 19 symphonies: nine of them while he was still in Berlin, the other ten in Hamburg. The Berlin symphonies seem to have been scored for strings only, but had wind parts added later. The first set of Hamburg symphonies, Wq. 182,1-6, were written at the behest of Baron van Swieten (well-known to readers of Mozart biographies) and are for strings only. The last four symphonies, Wq. 183, are in twelve parts for an orchestra of about 40 musicians including horns, oboes, flutes and bassoons. It seems that none of these works was written to satisfy popular taste or demand, and Emanuel Bach, whose effective life as a composer spans the periods known to students of German literature as "Empfindsamkeit" (sensibility) and "Sturm und Drang" (usually infelicitously translated as "storm and stress"), took the opportunity of creating short, but brilliant pieces full of originality and individualism - so full, in fact, that even contemporaries complained that he had sacrificed comprehensibility to originality. Repeated notes, leaps, sudden breaks, rapid changes of tempo, sudden horn blasts ... the list could go on. In a conversation with the poet Matthias Claudius, Emanuel Bach once criticized the music of his half-brother Johann Christian as having "nothing behind it" and added, "Music has higher intentions; it is not intended [merely] to fill the ear, but [rather] to set the heart in motion" (my translation from the German original).Although these symphonies are seldom heard and rarely recorded, they have found some excellent advocates. Five of the nine early "sinfonias" are to be found on a wonderful CD by "Les Amis de Philippe", directed by Ludger R&eacute;my, on the German specialist label cpo. Some deliciously raucous horn playing and excellent acoustics make for real listening pleasure, and Ludger R&eacute;my's liner notes are superb. The six string symphonies were recorded in 1977 or 1978 by the Academy of Ancient Music on L'Oiseau-Lyre and were recently re-released at budget price, a magnificent gift to the public with some glorious string playing and engineering that surpasses almost anything I have heard despite the analogue technology. The only drop of wormwood is the fact that the CD has no liner notes whatsoever.Perhaps Emanuel Bach's greatest symphonic achievement was his Wq. 183, granted a more than excellent performance by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment directed by harpsichordist Gustav Leonhardt on Virgin Veritas. The sound here is a little softer and milder than on the other two CDs, but the playing and musicianship is exquisite. I have absolutely no complaints about any of these three CDs, and if I were only able to own one of them, I would be very hard put to make a choice. Fortunately, I don't have to, instead I can enjoy all three. I doubt whether I will ever tire of listening to them.
Exquisite and magnificent sounds here... Male sopranos/altos, Baroque trumpets, a cornetto, trombones, drums and transparent sounding baroque strings. Fux writes music in a natural and straight forward manner - his  tunes are powerful and memorable. The first track, &quot;Victimae Paschali  Laudat&quot;, has a power and drive that establishes itself right from the  very first notes. It would be hard to imagine a better performance of this  and the following Missa Corporis Christi - the Wiener Akademie under Martin  Haselbock is in its element. Others will be fascinated and amazed that all  four soloists - Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass are men! David Cordier is the  falsetto soprano and Drew Minter is the falsetto alto. These voices blend  beautifully with the period instruments - particularly with the cornetto  and the trombones - in a way impossible for female voices.This CD will  take you into another world - and Johann Joseph Fux was, according to Carl  Philipp Emanuel Bach, Johann Sebastian Bach's favourite composer.A CD  that has brought much happiness to me.
I had the vinyl for this (which has a much better album cover, BTW) and I still remember the first time I heard it while shopping at Tower Records in NYC.  Had to have it then, and when the CD came out I immediately got that;  One of my favorite jazz CDs in my collection...especially since it's not live, which is almost always my preference.  (Might be direct to tape - it's that good for the energy.)
Frankie Paul was one of the first wave of new artists from the Kingston Jamaica dancehall scene that emerged in the early 1980s. When I visited Jamaica in 1984, Paul's monster hit "Pass the Tu-Sheng-Peng" was on every turntable in every dancehall on the island.Frankie Paul became a superstar in jamaica when he recorded "Tu-Sheng-Peng" a breezy celebration of the wonders of ganja complete with brass section that borrows George Harrison's sitar part from the Beatle's "Norwegian Wood."The entire "Pass the Tu-Sheng-Peng album was a brilliant tribute of the production skills of sound system wizard Henry Junjo Lawes. Each song was initially released as 12" vinyl single. The Roots Radics, Jamaica's top ranking studio band, lay down the deep riddims and the eternal groove of Flabba Holt's bass and Style Scott's one drop drumming make "Tu-Sheng-Peng"a bonafide reggae classic.This CD is a moderately priced twofer that combines Frankie Paul's first two albums.  It predates the rise of slackness D.J. style and the sleng teng craze that all but ended the great age of old school reggae that Marley's conscious lyrics and roots riddims began. The second album included is "Tidal Wave" another chestnut that was the 1985 follow-up to "Tu-Sheng-Peng."Frankie Paul is a brilliant musical prodigy with a powerful voice and the master of several instruments. Blind since birth, he was initially encouraged by Stevie Wonder who heard Frankie Paul play and sing on a visit to the Salvation Army School for the Blind. Frankie began recording at age 15, but "Tu-Sheng-Peng", at age 19, marked a turning point as he became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Junjo Lawes. Both of these albums are a delight for anyone who loves the roots and conscious reggae of the golden age.Since the early 1980's Frankie Paul has been a fixture on the Jamaican reggae scene, but he doesn't do a lot of American touring except for concerts in larger cities of the east and west coast where he still is tremendously popular among both the Caribbean expatriate and American black communities. He deserves a wider audience and who knows?... Frankie Paul is still in his thirties which is still young in "reggae years."  Burning Spear and Joseph Hill of Culture are both pushing 60 years of age and both have busy touring and recording careers.To their credit, the venerable American music label, Greensleves, has remastered all of the early dancehall hits by Frankie Paul's without losing the big booming hi-fi sound of Junjo Lawes' original dancehall mixes which were originally released as 12" vinyl singles. If you are a fan of classic reggae riddims, it really doesn't get any better than this, folks.
Well, it is about time that I started to review some of the work of the good old boys and girls from the bayous down in Cajun country.  Places like Lafayette and Lake Charles evoke memories of time and place in Cajun musical history. You know at the edges of the places where the likes of Hank Williams and Jerry Lee Lewis learned their crafts. And places where all kinds of mixes of music and races blended to form unique sounds all their own. Accordions, washboards, fiddles, guitars and what ever came to hand on those whiskey-drenched Saturday nights.And on those nights come names like Clifton Chenier and Booboo Chavis that form the black influenced strand of the music. The Hackberry Ramblers and the likes of Waylon Thibodeaux form another, the good old white boys.  French Acadian exiles, English "swamp foxes" of undetermined origin, black escaped slaves, "poor white trash"- it is all there mixed in one form or another. For the most part there were no serious conscious attempts to mix the strands but how could the intermixing influences be avoided in that small isolated area of southwest Louisiana.  And all under the umbrella of what I call the "French blues". Get your dancing slippers on.If you, like me, need to have your Cajun music with accordion then your first stop is to this band under review, Nathan Abshire and his Pine Grove Boys. For pure Saturday night party time down in Cajun country the band with Abshire leading the way with his accordion can't be beat.  Listen up to "Pine Grove Blues" "Musician's Life", "Sur le Courtableu", "Belisaire Waltz", "French Blues" and "Valse de Bayou Teche". Nice.
First of all, this performance has been reissued from a company called  Diva srl. under license by Maria Callas estate. I couldn't find it here,  but this is the same performance.I really must say that this recording  really puts the Levine recording with Domingo to shame. Hearing that first  aria by del Monaco gave me shivers. So much passion and power is a tenor I  have only heard in Melchior, Vickers and Bj&ouml;rling before. And I really must  say that this performance proves to me that live performances are far  better than studio performances. To hear both these artists at their peak  singing with the most passion is something that can never be captured in  the studio.Being also a great Callas fan, I was anything but  disappointed.The sound is the only little thing that's not so good, but  when you're hearing this stellar cast in the magnificent Teatro alla Scala  opera house masterly conducted by Antonino Votto, you don't think about  trivial things like that.I very highly recommend this performance to any  fan of the opera, Maria Callas or Mario del Monaco.
If I had to recommend one Bok CD, I would not hesitate to choose this one.  All of the songs have previously appeared elsewhere, but many of Bok's old albums have not yet been rereleased on compact disc; with the exceptions of 'McKeon's Coming' and 'Old Fat Boat,' none of the songs here are otherwise available on CD as of this writing.  And in any case, the thematic unity makes for a more immersive listening experience.The level of quality here is staggering; amost all of the songs--most of them originals--are classics.  Bok's oeuvre does not consist exclusively of nautical songs, but I think they're what he does best.  Most of them are very exciting and dramatic, and Bok's acoustic guitar and distinctive baritone brilliantly evoke the savagery and desolate beauty of the ocean.  He's also a gifted storyteller, as demonstrated on 'Saben the Woodfitter' and the epic 'Peter Kagan and the Wind' (if you like those--and you will--you should also check out Seal Djiril's Hymn).I envy you if you have yet to hear this music for the first time.  Even if you normally shy away from folk music, I'm almost certain that you will enjoy this, and indeed, that it will become an integral part of the soundtrack of your life.
Such a wonderful album.  Gordon Bok's music is calm and beautiful, and it's wonderful to hear a baritone voice from a folk singer.  The songs have a more repetitive style, which is soothing if not exciting.  I play this often when needing to relax.
I had heard the other symphonies (many more than once) before I decided to listen to the Eighth while - of all things - cutting my grass.  I don't remember the yard but I do remember that the first thing I did after my shower was to find this CD and play it.  What a revelation!!!In scope, it is the most ambitious, in sound, the most varied, in quality, perhaps the best.  I have to agree with the other reviewers that both the playing and the sounds of this long work are just fantastic.  One can almost imagine Widor sitting at his organ, composing and playing alternatively, trying out various melodies, harmonies and techniques.  This recording rivals any of my other organ CDs.  Bravo!
Ben van Oosten has recorded all the Widor organ symphonies and I own the three volumes that were recorded on the incredible Cavaill&eacute;-Coll 1890 organ located in the Abbey Church of Saint-Ouen at Rouen, Normandy, volumes which include this one plusWidor: Complete Organ Works, Vol. 3(Symphonies 6 and 5) andWidor: Complete Organ Works Vol. 4(Symphonies 7 and 9). (Volume 3 ends with the Toccata from Symphony 5 rather than the Finale from Symphony 6 because the former is the better finale for a recording.)The Saint-Ouen organ is said to be the most recorded organ in the world. Even Daniel Roth, the titular organist of the larger, 102-stop Cavaill&eacute;-Coll organ at Saint-Sulpice, where Widor himself served for 64 years, traveled to Rouen to make his latest recordingDaniel Roth Plays the Cavaille-Coll at Saint-Ouen in Rouen, France. The 32' Contre Bombarde in the extraordinary Abbey acoustic space is one of the wonders of the organ world. Widor, who dedicated the Saint-Ouen organ, referred to it as the "Michel-Angelo of organs." It remains one of the least modified of the Cavaill&eacute;-Coll organs, and is well maintained.Ben van Oosten knows this organ well, and is exceptionally talented. His pacing of Symphony 8 is wonderful, resulting in an excellent and enjoyable recording. I recommend it.The only better sounding recording of the Saint-Ouen organ, in my opinion, is the Priory recordingAbbey Spectacular! Organ Favourites from St. Ouen, Rouenby the English organist Gerard Brooks, available from Amazon only as a download. It truly is spectacular! Mr. Brooks is one of the Cavaill&eacute;-Coll experts contributing to the new (2012) 3 DVD-2 CD setThe Genius of Cavaill&eacute;-Coll.
This CD presents the rarely recorded version of Johann Sebastian Bach's complete solo violin works with piano accompaniment by Robert Schumann. Schumann's piano accompaniment adds a conversational element to the music that I would have sworn I would never have associated with these works. It is a musical conversation across centuries between two great German masters. You should not be worried about Schumann taking over control from Bach - Schumann's added piano part is only accompaniment as the title indicates. Besides this recording emphasizes the violin in the sound picture and places the piano in the background. The playing is good but it doesn't reach John Holloways's (on ECM) metaphysical heights... well, maybe these musicians don't aim for those heights at all... it is more of a human interpretation. Recorded 1994-1995 - good sound. All in all a more than just curious release - recommended.
These recordings made between 1948 and 1960 provide ample evidence that Armenian Pavel Lisitsian was indubitably one of the great baritones of the mid 20C but he remains relatively unknown to many Western collectors.His legato was exemplary, the power and brilliance of his voice extraordinary and his diction lapidary. His tone was dark yet his voice always sound free and unstrained in its upper reaches with ringing top notes and no ugly changes of gear; it is utterly even throughout its range. Verdi would undoubtedly found his vocal lay-out ideal to portray the great baritone roles in ""Un ballo indmaschera", "La traviata" and "Il trovatore" from which we hear arias (in Russian). He is not all about power; the soft central passage of "Eri tu" is most moving in its restraint. Of course, he is ideal, too, in Russian opera; just sample that most seductive and passionate of arias from "Pique dame", "Ya vas lyublyu" to hear his stellar quality. In my experience, only Yuri Mazurok, another Russian prince among baritones, could, in his prime, rival Lisitsian for smoothness of emission.Very few other baritones - perhaps ony Ruffo, Stracciari and Amato - provide the sheer visceral thrill Lisitsian evokes in the listener; it's a voice in a million.
For those of you who wonder if Caruso had a rival, the answer is Yes and his name was Leo Slezak.  Born the same year as Caruso (1873), Slezak's voice was even more powerful (so powerful, in fact, that the high notes  consistently &quot;blast&quot; the old recording process), even more poetic  (he sang EVERYTHING, from Mozart to Wagner), even more well-blended (he  could sing piano, pianissimo, forte, fortissimo, sometimes all the the same  phrase), and much more musical.  This 2-CD set covers the years 1928-29,  when Slezak was 55-56 years old, yet both the power and the poetic magic of  the voice are still intact.  By modern standards, a few of his lieder  performances don't work (too much rubato in &quot;Die Post,&quot; for  instance, slurred figures in &quot;Wohin?&quot; and not enough dramatic  bite in &quot;Zueignung&quot;), but when compared to Caruso he is  incomparably the greater artist.  Particularly wonderful are his versions  of &quot;Nacht und Traume,&quot; &quot;Die Nussbaum,&quot; Schubert's  &quot;Serenade&quot; and &quot;An die Musik,&quot; and the arias from  &quot;La Juive,&quot; &quot;Pagliacci&quot; and &quot;Otello.&quot; (In  fact, Slezak was THE preferred Otello in the years before Zenatello and  Melchior: he sang the role under both Gustav Mahler and Arturo Toscanini.)  The Wagnerian excerpts are conducted rather slackly, yet to hear Slezak  &quot;build&quot; the music during the complete Rome Narrative from  &quot;Tannhauser&quot; is to realize how much greater he was, not only than  Caruso but of Melchior as well.  Just as there was only one Caruso, there  was only one Slezak; and if your imagination can fill in the gaps in  Caruso's timbre, you can certainly imagine Slezak's rocket-like high notes  reverberating in a theatre with the palpable force of an earthquake....on  top of which, Slezak caressed words like a poet and sang straight from the  heart, without the least pretense or artifice.  There was no one else like  him in the history of music, and his influence on the following generation  of German tenors (Tauber, Wittrisch, Volker, Groh and Roswaenge) was as  powerful as Caruso's on the Italians.  Highly recommended!
This is an excellent recording of our Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli. The work of the producer of the CD (and the master recording) to reproduce his voice is perfect. Besides the singing, there  is a very important message (in spanish)  of the tenor himself for all of us to create and  preserve clasical musical institutions. Of course, such classes of institution were not common in those days.
There are two brilliant recordings of Ariadne captured on Strauss's birthday, June 11, both radio broadcasts with the composer present. They are the 1944 B&ouml;hm and this magnificent performance from 1935 with Clemens Krauss.  This recording sat on my shelf for years after I'd played it once.  Having long ago decided incorrectly that the sound was unbearable and Ursuleac's voice wasn't good enough, I finally pulled it out for another hearing after going through a recent Ariadne binge.  What a shock it was to hear the stupendous conducting of Clemens Krauss, who, in spite of the limitations of 1935 sound brought out details, beauty, and dramatic excitement that I had not heard in any of my other numerous recordings of this masterpiece.This is not really a highlights disc, as it is stated on Amazon.  It is a complete recording of the opera, the second part of the work; it unfortunately omits the prelude.  But let us rejoice over what we do have!  Rosvaenge is a Bacchus of supreme dramatic power, matched by Ursuleac's musicality, both supported by the peerless conducting of her husband, Clemens Krauss.  There are other Ariadnes with good singing, but most are flawed by either self-conscious or boring conducting (Sinopoli and Kempe) or inadequate singing (Price with Solti). I find the celebrated Karajan to be stodgy, stilted, and humorless to the point of being unlistenable.  Only Karl B&ouml;hm seems to have the excitement and dramatic flair that Krauss exhibited - both conductors were close with Strauss and were steeped in his idiom.  Another stellar recording of B&ouml;hm's Ariadne was captured in 1954 with Rudolf Schock and Lisa della Casa. Ariadne seems to benefit from a live performance, when the artists can expand before an audience.The entrance of Bacchus - "Circe, Circe" (pronounced differently by various tenors -) is my litmus test for an effective Ariadne.  This launches the love duet that concludes the opera, and if well sung and conducted effectively, is the point of departure for the listener into the ecstatic realms that Strauss intended for us.  While the coloratura spectacular Grossmachtige Prinzessa is a delicious treat, the dramatic finale between soprano and tenor is the ultimate transcendental operatic experience. Is it a parody of the love duet in Act II of Tristan?  If yes, it's done so convincingly as to be comparable.There is a cleaned up version of this performance available from Pristine. It was thanks to the extraordinary work of Andrew Rose at Pristine that I fully learned the qualitative difference between mp3 and flac sound. Pristine's flac Ariadne is heartstopping in its purity of sound and clarity of detail.In spite of Preiser's crackly sound, there is a vividness and dramatic punch to this release.  There are also two wonderful video performances conducted by B&ouml;hm. The earlier is at the Salzburg Festival with Reri Grist's outstanding Zerbinetta and Sena Jurinac's luminous Composer.  It's marred by the regrettable Ariadne of Hildegard Hillebrecht, who stood in for Christa Ludwig (what a loss).  A later, beautiful filmed version features Gundula Janowitz as Plato's Perfect Ariadne, but her partner, Rene Kollo, is not up to the muscular demands of Bacchus.  To my ears, the greatest Bacchus is Helge Rosvaenge, followed by a youthful Max Lorenz in B&ouml;hm's 1944 live performance, and Rudolf Schock in the live B&ouml;hm from 1954.
John Williams, well known by his beautyful performances on baroque and clasicist suites, mainly transcribed from luthe or mandolin scores, shows a superb behaviour in latin-american songs. The opening track, Antonio Lauro's Seis por Derecho (referring to the guitar six strings), is a marvel itself that's worth the price of the album. Not to mention T&aacute;rrega's Recuerdos de la Alhambra, with its moody tremolos... Modern composers, like cuban Leo Brouwer are also proudly performed here in Williams' hands and strings. A broad range style guitar album higly recommendable to students and classical guitar lovers.
The Piano concerto #10 was unfamiliar to me but I liked it very much.  Mozart was at his best and the performance was excellent as well.  The other performances were excellent as well.
Conductors of majaor orchestras are almost forced to lead politically incorrect Mozart performances. Their musicians play too well, with such polish and perfect ensemble that the music winds up sounding glib or canned. From Berlin, Karajan's Mozart was scorned as too sleek even by big-band standrards. Abbado tried an image makeover with a series of recordings for Sony that retained all the polish while being more vivacious and direct.This is probably the best release from that cycle (which ended abruptly after Sony found that it couldn't sell even a minimal output in the U.S.). The Posthorn Serenade dates from a live concert in 1992, the rest of the program is from the studio that year.  Abbado was clearly in a good mood; he conducts with dash and brio. At times his tempos are impatient -- the serenade is a long work with many repeats -- and attacks in the two delightful Marches in D tend to be fierce. But the Divertimento written for his sister Nannerl bubbles away, spiced with a pair of horns and an oboe. It's the highlight of the disc, since the catalog is already crammed with Posthorns.The overall feeling remains a bit sleek, which can't be helped, I suppose, and Sony's sound is overly bright in the upper registers. Those caveats aside, here is Mozart in a lighter vein expertly played.
I have had this since it was first released in 1994. This was the time in which the first Cds of this genre were starting to be made ( also check out the "MFS trip" if you like this, which is also quite mindblowing). My friend Leslie, who was my raving buddy at the time , heard it first and one night after clubbing we went back to her house and she said to me. "You have to hear this new CD, it will blow your mind, but you have to listen to it all in one go, no interruptions". So at 4am we start listening to this CD in religious silence and by the end we were both crying. I guess girls will be girls, even hardcore techno girls like we used to be. We were very into our music in those days and we used to get very emotional about it at times. Anyway, I took my copy home and from then on I would listen to this every other week or so. My boyfriend of that time used to call it my "Jumper on the Head music", as I always would lie down in the middle of the living room with a jumper on my head to create darkness, so I could get deeper into the trance. It was like a religious experience. A few months later I had the priviledge to meet Mr. Spoon in person at Club UK where he played an all night 6 hour long set.I complimented him on hiw awesome work on this CD and told him it was a true work of art, which he humbly appreciated from me. What a fierce looking guy. He spun his stuff all night, bare chested in his Jeans dungerres, full of tattoes, with a powerful and almost menacing gaze. A little intimidating, but such a powerful presence. Years on I stuill pull this CD out every now and then and listen to this deep and mysterious masterpiece. Sad that Mr. Spoon is no longer with us, leaving this world so young. He will never be forgotten. One of the best pioneers of trance music. And a big presence in this old ravers memory banks
I was in the music store going through the cheap $1.00 CD's when I saw Jam & Spoon amongst a cabinet full of rubbish. Considering I have 1000's of CD's in the dance/trance/techno department and the fact that I am a DJ and have loved dance music for 15 years, I knew exactly who Jam & Spoon were when I saw the CD. However, considering they have multiple albums, many different aliuses (e.g. Storm, Dance 2 Trance, and Tokyo Ghetto Pussy) and I haven't listened to any of their music in several months, I was thrown off by the title of the CD. I assumed it was a newer release with the '2001' being in the title. When I looked at the tracks very briefly, I saw "Stella" and immeadietly jumped to the conclusion that it was the new millenium remixes and not the original version.So I bought the CD, popped it in, expecting to hear their newer, slower sounds (post 1998), but what I heard was some of the best trance music ever. I kept asking myself, "Why is this so freaking awesome?" Then I got home and looked up this CD on Amazon and started seeing reviews about how this album is like a pioneer of trance music. I quickly grabbed the CD and looked closely at it and realized it was made in 1993, not 2001!!! I was dumbfounded, yet, to my surprise, I was so happy that I had picked up this CD. I cannot stress how powerful this album is.. it sounded like some of the newer progressive house music from 2004 and 2005 (e.g. Tilt and Way Out West) and it's still not dated, 12 years later. On top of that, the CD offers some very powerful deep, hard trance that I have been looking for ever since I really got into J&S;'s other project, Dance 2 Trance but was unable to find anything comparable.This CD gets 5 stars plus 5 more because it's not only living proof that J&S; are responsible for the incline of trance music, but it's also a CD that can be loved from the opening of "Heart Of Africa" until the final seconds of "Stellas Cry". However, it's "Find Me (Odyssey To Anyoona)" and "Tow Spys In The House Of Love" (tracks 2+3) that sets this CD off for me, in the way that they are intertwined together so perfectly. It's hard to understand why Jam & Spoon drop the hard trance style heard on this album and navigate into the Eurodance sound in later albums. All in all, this is one fine creation!
There are 2 significant releases from the '90's that reshaped the future &quot;face&quot; of club/dance music:  &quot;Tripomatic Fairytales 2001&quot; from Jam &amp; Spoon and &quot;Accelerator&quot; by Future Sound of London.  Both undeniably brilliant in how they pioneered what was to become &quot;trance,&quot; &quot;progressive trance,&quot;  &quot;art-house trance,&quot; et al.  &quot;Tripomatic&quot; is an all-inclusive work of art that only trained seekers of electronica will seek and enjoy.  This is the Mona Lisa of what was to come.  Experience this.
Jam & Spoon's first album, TRIPOMATIC FAIRY TALES 2001, revels in the heady club days of the early 90s, with sweet synths and melodies to hit the ears in just the right places. "Heart of Africa" starts things off slow, with a mid-tempo track that hints at Africa more than getting to its heart, but which segues into pure techno in its last minute in order to lead into "Odyssey to Anyoona," a classic Jam & Spoon trance track with long, deep grooves and a looped sample from what sounds like a Bulgarian women's choir. Better still, the timeless classic "Stella" makes an appearance. After such a classic, "Neurotrance Adventure" and "Zen Flash Zen Bones" pale a bit in comparison, even though they have their own blissful moments. The massive club hit "Right in the Night," with its flamenco flair, also appears here. I could have done without the 'poetic' interludes that dot the album or the more generic tracks, such as "Paradise Garage," but the stronger tracks more than fulfill the need to dance, from the longing cry on "Path of Harmony" to the faux didgeridoo of "Earth Spirit" or the other club hit, "Find Me." Towards the end of the album, "Stellas Cry" isn't so much a reprise as a new track, with a nice piano breakdown leading into the beat. Still, for all its minor missteps, this album is still a classic.
The two Bartok Rhapsodies, (and the 2nd Concerto of Bartok along with his recording of the Berg) are considered by most good violinists I know to be the pinnacle of the legacy of this somewhat erratic genius.There are better recordings of the Prokofiev (marginally - these are terrific, too) but no better Rhapsodies. They are fabulous. And I doubt that they'll ever be surpassed because the current crop of children can't play.Grab this one before it gets deleted.
I heard the E major concerto contained within this album on Classical King FM 98.1 this morning while driving to work.  It was way too good not to buy!This is simply THE BEST performance of these violin concertos I have ever heard.---Matthew C. Weiss
This CD is truly amazing! It contains songs (all in Spanish) both cheery and sad and has the popular favorite Volver Volver. This CD helped get me through some bad sorrows in my life, and still does. Has corridas and uplifting sounds as well as melancholy ones. I would suggest you buy this one and keep it as part of your Hispanic collection. I still carry it around in my organizer if and when I feel like hearing it again or sometimes when I feel low. I have to warn you, however, those Gritos might get you in trouble! lol :-)
That Edgar is one fine piece of man meat.... He is the straw that stirs the drink with this band. Totally reccommended from the world famous SGS#1
Have loved this album since I first heard. Happy to have it again. Now with my mp3 player. there's no more track skipping from overplay.
I have nothing but high praise for this greatest hits compilation of Rita Coolidge. It has all of the best recordings made a hit by her in this collection. I highly recommend this CD to all of Ms. Coolidge's fans. You will not be disappointed !!
Hard to believe there are no reviews of this record.  There may be more 'classic' recordings from the 20s and 30s, but this is real New Orleans jazz played by artists who played every night in the Crescent City.  I find it moving and uplifting, educational and entertaining.  I love it.
This is a classic hard rock(not heavy metal) record. Rick Rubin stripped all the pretentious goth wannabe elements of the Cult and showed them how to be a freaking Rock band! Great vocals, solid rhythm section, great riffs and solos. Lived off this record for years and still go back to it when I need a Hard Rock fix. Rick Rubin can make the Chipmonks rock if he was given the chance...look what he did to Beasties, J-Z, emimem, and especially Johnny Cash.
Much simpler than the average hard rock album, much easier than your Pearl Jam album, much stronger than most albums that come out today! A very good CD, very easy to listen to, just guitar bass and drum, with a very good  melodic talent. Actually, I think the good thing of the album is the mix  between the pure energy and the melodic creativity, the rithm and the  sound! Wild Flower, Electric Ocean, Love removal machine are very powerful  songs, good if you want to listen while jogging, or driving. Don't  underestimate this band, it's not a CD just for bikers or for fans of Deep  Purple, it's a very good solid rock album, reminds me more of Lou Reed's  &quot;New York&quot; album than of some Hard Rock band. Of course, Led  Zeppelin influence is strong, but not as much as people say, this CD has  more rithm and less melody than your typical Zep's album.
...then, I bought it in cassette form...and now, I'm buying the CD.  I love &#34;The Cult&#34; and this is one of their best recordings.  It was made when the band was young and fresh and before the colliding egos of Ian and Duffy started hampering their creativity.  It's also a little harder than some of their later CDs.  Great riffs!
Personally, I think it's great they did'nt make "Love" part two, cause this album just kicks you in the face man! Don't get upset,"Lovies", here me out. I listened to nothing else but this album for a year, and even today it blows the doors off all this bubble gum punk/numetal/top40/MTV crap. "ELECTRIC" is an unadulterated rock album, comparison to anything else does'nt do it justice. Ian has the most powerful lungs you'll ever hear, and Duffy's guitar just punches through the walls. The band is just solid and the songs have alot of raw snap. This record does'nt need all the theatrics, the music is the epitome of energy(too much enthusiasm?(don't care!)). I'm not going to break down any songs or tracks cause they all stand up on thier own. After this album kicks you in the face, don't look up.
If you like any song by the Cult buy this album. You will not be disappointed at all. I great piece Rock and Roll. Every single song on here I have listened to hundreds of times and I am still not tired of them. Lil Devil and  Aphrodisiac jacket are tremendous standouts.Even Born to Wild is not that badI suggest even getting the Vinyl.
One of the best albums of the `80's period, `Electric' brought English quartet the Cult into the car stereos of mainstream America.  Produced by Rick Rubin, the mad genius behind Slayer and the Beastie Boys, Ian and Billy left their goth rock behind and made a retro yet fresh metal record with more than a passing nod to AC/DC.  `Electric' contains three of their most memorable songs in classics "Love Removal Machine", "Wild Flower" ("Rock n' Roll Singer" by another name) and "Lil' Devil" and all rocked proudly, more than anything the band had hinted at in their previous incarnations. The video for "Machine" was the epitome of rock star glory! "Peace Dog" is a sledgehammer. "Memphis Hip Shake" is mad bad and tremendously evil and delicious. "Aphrodisiac Jacket" has some of the dumbest lyrics ever but the song kicks so much ass and Ian sings like he believes every word so who cares! "Bad Fun", "Outlaw" and man even "Born to Be Wild" (which most people seem to hate) all add to the onslaught (Am I the only one who likes it better than the original?).  `Love' may have signaled a changing of the guard but it was `Electric' that will stand as the Cult's finest contribution to rock music. Star of my dreams, most beautiful thing...I love you every hour...look out here she comes!
I noticed a lot of people who loved their first two albums diss this one. Let me guess you probaly also like new wave and punk which is fine, but people tend to forget the Cult are an eclectic band that doesn't honor just one genre or have a signature sound and never make the same album twice and if it ticked you off that they cranked up their sound well then i'm glad they did. I like all the cult's albums old and new and theyone of my favorites.
I truly enjoyed the album.  A must have to your Cult collection.
Wasn't what I was listening to in 87! At that stage I was still finding my taste and Led Zep, Sabbath, AC/DC were what was going on for me in Oz. Although we do have a great alt rock program called Rage which highlights bands from artists. The Cult were always on the roster, but just the classic - Sanctuary and Love Removal machine.So after years (and funds to buy what I want now), this is probably one of their best albums. It's got that punk/new wave/rock feel to it. And of course the cover born to be wild. Although I think the Tatts did a cover about the same time too!Leaving nothing from what they left - if you like rock, it's a really good rock 80's album, but not GNR or Crue type 80's metal rock. Think this one shoud be in everyones CD rack
If you want to go crazy put this on. Good for workouts.My favorite cult album.
This is a rocker! Stealing riffs by the Stones sometimes sounding like 'Start me up' in so many ways! But with the driving guitar from the man, Billy Duffy and his sanded down Gibson Les Paul Custom! I saw them live and when they did cuts off this album, they were fawkin' great! This is a killer album! One of the best of the 80's!
My Japanese-born wife wanted some Stephen Foster, which is very popular in Japan. She really enjoyed this DVD. The choral arrangements are quite beautiful.
Another Natalie Cole album I've been searching everywhere for and couldn't find. It is very clear, exactly like I remember when I was in college.  I love it!!!
From 1975 to 1978 Natalie Cole released a string of strong selling well crafted R & B/Pop albums.  This era's nadir was 1978's "Thankful" album, and it's breakout hit "Our Love".Her partnership with Chuck Jackson and Marvin Yancy yeilded a unique, and distinctive sound for Natalie without reliying on her father's legacy.This live set showcases her polished stage persona, and takes you on a journey with such diverse cuts as "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds", "Que Sera Sera", "Party Lights", the beautiful ballad"Inseprable", and the gospel punch of "Something's Got a Hold of Me" and "Be Thankful".The final tracks were recorded just as her mega hit "Our Love" was riding the top of the charts, and her extended read of this hit caps a great live album.It was not long after this albums release that Natalie's personal deamons came back to haunt her, and send her career in to a decline, as we know she came back and them some!, but she never focused on R & B again, like she did during this era.
This is Natalie in her prime and @ her best! Back n the day you had to have a live album! They had some classic's like The Spinners live,Teddy live, EWF Gratitude, just to name a few. Then you had Natalie live you played this until it couldn't play no more! What i like about this cd is how she takes control & has the crowd eating out of her hand! If you want to hear some good live singing (no sampling)Then i recommend you check this cd out you will not be disappointed!
I also can't believe it's not still in print.  I got my CD a few years back when it first came out but I am surprised that they haven't printed anymore.  Natalie has been through a lot and is still doing her thing!!
In the 70's and 80's so  many black artists performed at the Latin Casino. When Atlantic City opened up, the casino went out of business. What a waste. Because the Spinners, TSOP, Billy Paul, and Natalie would come to the Latin and bring down the house. This is one of the best of that musical genre.
Whether you're really into classical music or just a casual listener, you can't go wrong with this CD. The first work, Carnival of the Animals, is sheer fun. The melodies and choice of instruments really convey the essence of each animal, while Saint-Saens' humor and wit shine through in the subtle jabs he takes at critics and woefully inept piano students. Carnival is also wonderful for children, as they can learn to identify the selections with their favorite animals.If that weren't enough, the rest of the selections are just as fantastic. Like the above reviewer, I love Danse Macabre and its ingenious use of strings, but Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso is not to be missed either. I can honestly say that not a single track on this CD disappointed me, and would highly recommend it to anyone.
A exciting live recording!!! In concert or live onstage she is the consummate performer. Certainly a must have album for her fans.
EXCELLENT WORK... However, we wanted to play this songs by ourselves, but there are no musical notes. That is the only missing part.
I remeber watching this musical with my dad, since I pretty much love any musical and Roger and Hammersteins, I got this
I ordered a soundtrack tape of "The King and I" .  I needed the song "Getting to Know You", for a project at our local Nursing Center. I ordered the tape and within 3 days the tape arrived. This was a used tape, but it was in excellent condition, just as advertized.  I will certainly use Amazon.com again.
No problems at all.  Nothing to say, just a good old classic, bought for my handicapped sister who adores it.
I was in love with Yul Brynner as a child. I always loved the movie (the original). Now I have the CD which is absolutely fabulous. I also have the stage CD which doesn't touch the original.
I am very pleased with the recording.  It met my expectations and I am enjoying it. It is a good as the original recording.
The editorial comment reflects the strong recommendation given to this CD in the "Penguin Guide to Compact Discs".  I add my own recommendation also, not only for this CD but for the whole project which it initiates, the plan to  provide a truly complete survey of Schubert's song output.The accompanist and moving spirit throughout is Graham Johnson.  In his notes, he mentions inheriting a ten-volume Schubert edition, full of pencil markings, from legendary accompanist Gerald Moore.  The older accompanist, collectors will remember, made a memorable series of Schubert lieder recordings with Dame Janet Baker.  Well here is Dame Janet in her mid-fifties but still in vocal splendour, together with the younger accompanist, recorded in 1987.One of the principles of this huge recording project is to match singers with songs.  Anyone privileged to attend a recital by Dame Janet, a tall statuesque figure, will once again enjoy the experience of sharing music that seems to suit her perfectly. In "An den Mond", a song requiring a vocal range of almost two octaves, Dame Janet's lower register is used with remarkable dramatic power.There is, moreover, the miracle of  Schubert's genius, illuminating the texts of Goethe, Schiller and other of the German poets.  A minor miracle is that such illumination was possible at such a young age.  The 17-year-old Schubert begins, for example, the song "N&auml;he des Geliebten" with a swelling crescendo which accompanist and singer share, wonderfully well-contrived to suggest urgency.  Other examples could be provided, but I hope this is enough to recommend this CD, if not the whole edition of 37 or more, to music lovers everywhere.
This disc is one of two released by Hyperion in exploration of Stravinsky's choral music. It contains many gems, familiar and otherwise, and makes for a tremendously valuable addition to any collection.An excellent ploy is the use of two experienced choirs for the recording: the New London Chamber Choir and the Voronezh District Chamber Choir, with James Wood and Oleg Shepel as respective conductors. Whilst some may find the latter choir a slightly odd-sounding group, their presence adds a wonderfully authentic flavour to the music, most of which dates from Stravinsky's early period - commonly described as his 'Russian' period. Indeed, they open the disc with Four Bridal Songs from the Voronezh District itself, complete with tambourines and dancing (although of course only the tambourines are evident in the recording). These are a superb appetiser for what follows.The title work &quot;Les Noces,&quot; also known as &quot;Svadebka&quot; or even just simply &quot;The Wedding,&quot; is without a doubt one of Stravinsky's most celebrated works. As with the Russian Songs, it is a pity that in listening to it we cannot also enjoy the accompanying choreography, although Stravinsky called for a large array of percussion instruments in the score and these add an almost aural choreography to the work. The two featured choirs join forces for this together with four outstanding soloists (including John Potter) and four deft pianists, resulting in a colourful, gripping and explosive performance.Stravinsky's &quot;Four Russian Peasant Songs&quot; for women's choir deserve to be better known, and here we get the opportunity to listen to both versions: one for unaccompanied voices, the other for voices and four horns. These show as well as anything that part of Stravinsky's mastery lay in his ability to evoke a chosen style whilst remaining completely true to his own: if you can programme your CD player to play these and the opening traditional songs in sequence, you will see for yourself just how successfully this music works.Westminster Cathedral Choir have recorded Stravinsky's &quot;Three Sacred Choruses&quot; in Latin for Hyperion; on this disc you can hear the original Slavonic versions. They are entrusted to the Voronezh Choir under Oleg Shepel, and he does some rather surprising things to the music (for instance, it is sung at more flexible speeds and with a curious degree of vibrato and 'swoopy' phrasing than on other recordings I have heard). Still, it is good to have them in sequence, presented as Stravinsky might have heard them upon returning to his homeland after nearly a whole lifetime in exile. The New London Chamber Choir follows these with three sacred pieces of a different kind: these began life as unfinished motets by Carlo Gesualdo. Stravinsky was fascinated by them and elected to finish them, but in the process his own musical thumbprints were placed on the music and what we thus hear is a curiously compelling mixture of flavourful Italian polyphony and twentieth century idioms. It is not hard to imagine these being sung in worship.The programme closes with two fruits of Stravinsky's final years - his serial period. &quot;The Dove Descending&quot; is an eerily beautiful setting of a well-known poem by T. S. Eliot (another figure greatly admired by the composer) and provides further demonstration that Stravinsky could still sound like himself whilst under the influence of Schoenberg's twelve-tone discipline. The &quot;Introit in memory of T. S. Eliot&quot; which closes the disc is a more obviously serial work, setting the opening text of the Requiem Mass for male voices and a small ensemble (viola, double bass, piano, harp and percussion). This is Stravinsky at his grittiest, yet the music - right down to the timbre of the instruments combined - expresses the mood of the text in a wonderfully sublime manner.This disc is a worthwhile investment, whether you are a Stravinsky addict, a Stravinsky student or just plain curious. It presents an amazingly varied range of works, each one a gem in its own way, performed to a very high standard. Colourful, exciting, well-made: I recommend it.
Those not familiar with Liszt's religious music, particularly his later music, might not know what to expect.  Seeing requiem they may think "Mozart" or even the more contemporary (with Liszt) Brahms.  Couldn't be farther from the truth.This requiem is very intimate, almost introverted.  It is music, like the 16th century music Liszt used as his model, that is designed for quiet reflection, for mediation, for introspection.  It is not like the Baroque Bach's communal celebration trying to share the universal experience.  Most religious work of the late 18th and 19th century seems to follow the Baroque mode while Liszt was eyeing the Renaissance.  It often has a chant like quality, though there are are powerful moments with the full men's chorus and organ and on occasion brass and timpani, for instance about a minute in on the Dies irae.This might seem strange to those used to Liszt as being over the top and showy, but that is how he usually handled his religious music.Hints of Palestrina and Lassus aside, this is still pure Liszt.  Remember, harmonically Wagner followed Liszt.  The results are often very modern sounding and, to my ear, fresher than most 18th or 19th century religious music.  Maybe not quite Messiean, but still fresh...I only received this a few days ago and have listened to it 2  times through, but so far I love it - going from almost tender, a little sad, to very powerful.  There is never any terror in it - it is a loving religion Liszt believed in - and remember, he was very religious.Highly recommended.
Annie Fischer's complete recordings of the Beethoven piano sonatas are a treasure. Recorded during the 70's, not one was released during her lifetime. However, she did approve of final takes on all 32 before she passed away and thankfully, these great performances are finally available. She has an expressive tone the displays all the nuances of Beethoven's far-reaching set. She has a knack for capturing the perfect tempo every time. I regularly return to any of these recordings, including this one, to just rediscover these superb renditions. Any in this series is a solid purchase you will enjoy again and again.  And whoever said Stiff and Labored is really hearing a different set of recordings then most everyone else who has sampled this treasure chest.
I can say without exaggeration that this is the finest version of the "Hammerklaiver" I have ever heard, and I've heard many great ones.  Fischer is somehow able to penetrate right to the core of this music and make one experience it fresh as a vivid, emotional encounter.  Sorry if that sounds fanciful, but it is very difficult to describe the impact of Fischer's playing.  In particular, she holds together the very long slow movement, and the very long fugue, like no other pianist I have heard.  Some performances make me feel that Beethoven overdid it in these two movements.  Not here.  With Fischer, you hang on every note.Oh, and by the way, Fischer's technique is stunning: ferocious octaves, exquisite dynamic control and pedaling, perfect balance between the two hands.What I have said above applies to Fischer's entire set of Beethoven sonatas.  They are one of the great achievements in recording history.
Frequently, Western composers who choose to work in non-Western musical traditions are demonized as &quot;culural rapists&quot; who simply use these traditions as gimmicks or &quot;hooks&quot; to create interest in their work.  Unfortunately, some of these composers _do_ run roughshod over the cultures they claim to be celebrating.  This collection of works, however, is another story.  Rarely have I found a group of new pieces that are so solidly rooted in a non-Western tradition (here, the Balinese gamelan gong kebyar) and yet so fresh and contemporary.  All the pieces here are well-crafted and represent the work of composers who are literate in multiple musical traditions.  My personal favorites are Evan Ziporyn's two contributions, especially his collaboration with noted Balinese composer I Nyoman Windha, &quot;Kekembangan.&quot;  Every piece merits repeated listenings, though. This disc is a rich tapestry of compositions that can be enjoyed by lovers of gamelan and contemporary music alike.  A welcome addition to any CD library.
Peter Ecklund: Strings Attached is a magnificent collection of songs by an expressive trumpeter.  He does the theme melodically, then variations with care.  His supporting cast(s), several different groupings, provide solid  backgraound, as well as solos harmonious in spirit with the lead trumpet.  9 of the 16 selections were composed by Peter Ecklund, wonderful new  melodies and harmonic progressions are to be enjoyed.  Recording is  excellent.  Worth slipping into the CD player to re-enjoy for month after  month.
Hanns Eisler's &quot;Lenin Requiem&quot; has never been performed in the United States--and may never be. Eisler was nothing if not a contextual composer, and here the context is Eisler's identification with Lenin and the Russian Revolution. But this is no example of quasi-religious bombast  in the style of &quot;socialist realism&quot;--Eisler uses advanced  compositional techniques, including atonality, and for this reason the  Lenin Requiem was never performed in the Soviet Union! It did reach the  concert stage in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), where  Eisler settled after his deportation from the United States as a suspected  Communist subversive in the Hollywood film industry. This is one of the  rare performances--a collector's item of enduring musical worth.The  Lenin Requiem is perhaps one of Eisler's most satisfying works: both the  music and the text by Bertolt Brecht are free of hero worship (another  reason the work was disliked by the Soviet cultural apparatus), but  nevertheless communicate a sense of concentrated emotive power. It is also  one of Eisler's more engaging attempts to write compositions that used the  most progessive techniques of his day--including the 12-tone method of his  teacher Arnold Schoenberg--but in a particularly simplified form so that  the untrained ear would still hear the music as music.Also on the album  is one of Eisler's least successful works--the &quot;Party Cantata&quot;  written for the Fifth Congress of the ruling Communist Party of East  Germany. Eisler's fans have described this as his &quot;Wellington&quot;--a  reference to Beethoven's forgettable tribute to the British general. Even  the Communist minister of culture, Johannes Becher, was embarrassed. Still,  the cantata has the gusto of a lively collegiate fight song.Fortunately,  Eisler was not really the favored court composer for the Communist regime  his critics have made him out to be; not long after the Fifth Party  Congress, he was exiled from East Germany because his musical theories did  not fit in with the ruling doctrine of socialist realism in music,  literature and art. He returned when Stalin's death signalled a cultural  thaw throughout the Soviet empire.Shortly before his death, he wrote  the &quot;Ernste Gesaenge&quot; (&quot;Serious Songs&quot;), also which are  striking for their tenderness and emotional complexity, and buttress the  argument that Eisler was perhaps one of the greatest composers of German  lieder in the 20th century. They are presented here, along with the  extraordinary miniatures Eisler wrote to Brecht's captions for a picture  book describing war.
I was surprised and delighted by the quality and charm of these Quartets - modelled after Haydn's op 33, say the liner notes - and Dittersdorf once played quartets with Haydn, Mozart, and Vanhal.  Quite a group!  All 6 are in three movements, major keys, and strive for no great depth of feeling - just a general Gem&uuml;tlichkeit - but the ideas have novelty, there are modulatory surprises, and there's lots of character.  Bravo Dittersdorf!  My only reservation is that the set occupies two CDs with a total timing of about 90 minutes.
Though unfamiliar with this artist I took a chance on the basis of some short sample excerpts and am relighted with the cd and the whole transaction.
Like the other Polynesian countries, Tonga is famous for its polyphonic choir music and these recordings made in 1986 and 1990 are a representative sampling. It's another in a great series by Ad and Lucia Linkels.
Tchaikovsky's output for violin and piano isn't overly large and does not showcase the composer at his scintillating best. Still, there is some eminently fine music here. The M&eacute;ditation and the S&eacute;r&eacute;nade Melancolique are of course familiar enough from their versions with orchestra and do not gain anything from the sparer textures and not always idiomatic piano writing. The Valse-scherzo is a brilliant work of color, charm and memorable ideas, however. I would, on the other hand, not go out of my way to obtain this version of the Andante Funebre - it is undeniably effective, but pales in comparison with the original string quartet version (string quartet no.3). The three smaller pieces are attractive, however. The Scherzo is busy, almost frantic, the M&eacute;lodie quite lovely and the Humoresque charmingly cheerful.The performances are absolutely marvelous, however - and should make this release a must to many listeners despite the fact that the music is hardly top-drawer Tchaikovsky. Kagan and Lobanov are completely attuned to the musical language; Kagan's phrasing is gorgeous and the tone surprisingly varied (but always with a certain warmth to it). The sound is generally fine, although a little "too big" for the music (letting the violinist a little too far back in the sound picture at times), yet the performances secure a top rating for this one.
The Sibelius Violin Concerto is a basic in the repertoire of any violinist of note. Young award-winning fiddler Pekka Kuusisto teams with the original Sibelius orchestra led by Leif Segerstam for a very fine and totally Finnish performance...and it's beautifully recorded in state-of-the-art sound by the Finnish Ondine engineers!The two suites of incidental music are also beautifully performed in the same lush and expansive manner. I particularly love the alternatingly poetic and lilting Karelia Suite; the delicate opening pianissimo is sublimely rendered and sounds as natural as can be when the dynamic range and frequency response is as wide as here. I went back and played the whole suite again.
Recording quality aside (which while it could be better, is no where near as bad as some will have you believe), her playing is tight, passionate and excellent... and far more effective than the Barenboim recordings, which are too eccentric-sounding (not to mention self-indulgent; less Barenboim, more Mozart, please) for my tastes. Regarding the matter of Mozart and "lightness", that, too, is a stylistic choice, and, ultimately, matter of preference... even if it is a widely-accepted one. Unless someone uncovers some original Mozart recordings (good luck!), we never will know how the great man intended his music to be played, will we?
This early recording by Craig Ogden is authoritative i.e. seriously good.  Thank you Craig - a local hero from WA.Cheers Graham
Joseph Haydn: Violin Concertos; Sinfonia Concertante is a recording under Adam Fischer who leads the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra and starring Rainer Kuchl on violin. Geraint Lewis and David Andrew Threaser have written a very interesting essay on the work in question. It also contains biographies of the soloists. It is truly a pleasure to listen to a violinist of Kuchl's ability. Highly recommended. 5/5.
After many years of listening to singers from "The Cobweb Department", I happened upon Spanish tenor, Antonio Cortis (1891 - 1952). Jan Neckers listed him as a finalist - "In Search of the Ten Best Recordings of Nessun Dorma" ([...]On this CD the arias, mainly from mainstream Italian and French opera, are all sung in Italian, with a few Spanish songs bringing up the rear.Mainly self taught, with some advice from Caruso during a production of Pagliacci in 1917, Cortis sings with a similar command and authority to the great man. His voice is lighter, less baritone, but more agile and perhaps a tonal amalgam of Caruso and Harry Secombe.While not as markedly characteristic as his compatriot, the mezzo soprano Conchita Supervia, you will hear a similar approach to infectious rhythm and expressive flow. Indeed the flow seemed to me to be more akin to a dancer "playing with the music", sometimes slightly lagging the beat, sometimes moving almost against it; these are very sophisticated lyric-spinto performances.Cortis gives equal weighting to both music and lyrics. His top notes are easily produced, never excessive - serving the needs of the piece rather than pitching to the audience.The well written sleeve notes suggest a few reasons Cortis did not make it into the big time. He never sang at the Met (although he sang at other major American houses), perhaps he was badly managed and he did not push himself forward.There is some surface noise but the voice and approach are so engaging you'll probably say, "What surface noise?"There is a generous 79 minutes of music.I have not received a more pleasant aural surprise for years. Top marks.
There are a lot of great trumpet players out there who play well and have agood sound.....I think Ray Mase is at the top of the list with a select other few(ex. Phil Smith, Hakan Hardenberger, Alison Balsom)
I bought this to use at a wedding reception.  If you're looking for some Csardas music, this is great!
I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL RECORDINGS FROM THE "TIMELESS HISTORICAL' SERIES AND CAN SAY THAT THESE RECORDINGS LEAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING TO BE DESIRED; WELL CHOSEN ORIGINAL RECORDINGS TECHNICALLY PRESENTED ALONG WITH WONDERFUL ILLUSTRATIONS AND LINER NOTES THAT PRESENT CRITICAL DATA ABOUT THE MUSIC AND THE PERFORMERS THAT WILL LEAVE THE READER WELL VERSED ABOUT THE RECORD AT HAND. AN A-ONE PRODUCT THE THE DUTCH CAN BE WELL PROUD OF.
This recording is very similar to the Art Pepper Quartet, Tampa Masters. The Marty Paich Quartet featuring Art Pepper is also a Tampa Masters recording of the same period (1956). The personal are Pepper, Paich, Buddy Clark, bass and Frank Capp, drums. Marty Paich is a fine composer and player but this is clearly Pepper's album. Combine this recording with the aforementioned Art Pepper Quartet (Tampa} and you  have a flawless, flowing, horn of plenty two sets of music.  There is such  beauty in his music and unfortunately not in other aspects of his being. These sets exemplify the artist he was.
Once again V.S.O.P., has re-issued a classic jazz vocal album on CD, complete with original cover artwork, and everything.  Many people today may not remember Joy Bryan in the 1950's and it's a shame, she was one of the finest jazz vocalists, in the same class as June Christy and Chris Connor, if not as jazz oriented as Anita O'Day.  Bryan sings backed by Marty Paich's wongerful arragements, who also happened to arrange Mel Torme's finest lp's on Bethlehem.  Paich's smooth and jazz oriented arrangemets match Bryan's unique style.  Bryan sounds somewhat Betty Carter/Sarah Vaughan influenced, yet her style is all her own.  She takes plenty of chances and plays with the melody(which is why she has so much in common with Carter), her range is beautiful, and the opener &quot;I Was Doing Allright&quot; is swinging and very jazzy.  The entire cd is a gem, and Miss Bryan sings several modernized 1920's tunes, she brings &quot;Mississippi Mud&quot; back to life, away from the cotton fields, and with tactfuly altered &quot;politicly correst&quot; lyrics.  Overall a perfect TEN, cd on a scale of one to ten.  Thank you V.S.O.P. for keeping some of the best jazz alive from the 50's, for a new generation of jazz lovers.
I live in southern California and when it would snow I'd bundle up the wife and our son and we'd throw our boots and snow gear in the trunk and away we'd go. And up in the mountains, there was a funky little store that smelled of well trod wood flooring and scented candles and candy in a jar and they'd always have some wild winterwood music playing and I loved that place and it was a fantasy store for me and it was this kind of music - Dulcimer Christmas - that they'd have on in the background and I'd always buy it - whatever it was - so I bought it again and if you love the mountains in winter, buy this music. It'll transport you there. And then some hot apple cider and cuddle with the one you love. And put a log on the fire and the lights on the tree. This is the portal that can take you there.
~ Denny Freeman was a mainstay of the Austin TX music scene in the 1970's and 1980's and as such had a major influence on brothers Stevie Ray and Jimmie Vaughan.  In fact, Denny and Stevie played together in Paul Ray's band The Cobras.  Unfortunately, Denny has not been granted the recording exposure that the Vaughan brothers have enjoyed, but the few available Denny Freeman recordings are treasures.~ Denny Freeman's 1986 LP "Blues Cruise" and his 1987 LP "Out of the Blue" are combined on a single CD titledBlues Cruise.  Encompassing 20 tracks and spanning 72 minutes, "Blues Cruise" offers Austin-style blues-rock at it's finest.  Freeman is joined on that CD by a who's who of mid-1980's Austin blues scene: Jimmie Vaughan, Angela Strahli, Kaz Kazanoff, Joe Sublett, Mel Brown, Kim Wilson, Jon Blondell, and more. The core rhythm section for the entire CD is Sarah Brown (bass) and George Rains (drums).  The CD is available through Amazon.~ "A Tone for My Sins" was recorded in 1997, several years after Freeman had relocated to Los Angeles.  Eleven of the twelve tracks are penned by Freeman, while one track is composed by Denny and his old pal saxophonist Joe Sublett.  The CD clocks in at a mere 48 minutes, but that is 48 enjoyable minutes.  While the 1980's "Blues Cruise" CD achieved diversity by varying the settings, blues styles, instrumental combinations, and adding a few vocal contributions, "A Tone for My Sins" achieves diversity through a variety of a variety of blues styles as well as a variety of soundscapes.  The blues offered here varies from straight-ahead blues to blues-rock to a little country-blues and on the final track a leaning towards jazz-blues (a hint of things to come).  Varying the soundscape, and perhaps in reference to the CD title, Freeman varies the tone of his guitar from track to track, making sure the tone is appropriate for the blues style - sometimes mellow and warm, sometimes country twang, sometimes bright, sometime biting, but never harsh or irritating.  A few tunes are waw-waw drenched, and these are perhaps the weakest tracks.  On one song Denny plays lead on a six-string bass to great effect.  Joe Sublett adds welcome sax support on two tracks.  On a few tracks Freeman overdubs his own Hammond organ, piano, or electric piano, but these added effects never compete with the guitar as the main instrument.~ If you are looking for 48 minutes of straight-ahead guitar blues, and you are not familiar with the compositions and guitar playing of Denny Freeman, this CD is a great place to start.  It also serves as a stepping stone to his subsequentTwang Bang
DENNY FREEMAN:  A TONE FOR MY SINSOut of four (+ a German Cobras') records, this is third, a 1997 effort and, for the record, a Denny-buff's dream--just straight ahead, subdued, brilliant ability and some thought.  I kept being forced (by my CD player) back to cut #1 "Vigilante" that and realized I liked it  The other pulpy fiction feel is on "Aftershock" where the fast and funkiness had me calling for Mum.  Cute Joe Sublett played deeper sax, though, on (and co wrote) "Wah Wah Toosie" (sp?), a groovy, impressive guitar/bass (Share Ross) tandem melody ride.Though poetry transcends the other three separate genres in literature, "Swingset" blurs musical lines and has maybe one flash (livens up itself) in a new moon "sacred" forest.  BUT the CD's last song makes it all well.  In "Rhythm Method" (we likes jazz), Mr. D is real and old (me leg was a'bouncin').  Before this is a sweet "Soul Burden" (name that singer for some Pursuit pie) which has a ping antithetical to SRV's "Riviera Paradise"'.  I kept reaching for Parade mag (oops) during this one and one other, "Swamp Box", where Kathy Valentine chirps on the wah wah guitar while Denny slides and is still ok-pokey.I GOT "Stealin' Berries Part II"; he is makin' jam (serto's other use), and I liked the same guitar throughout.  "Catfight" I did not get though my dog did; but as if a counterpoint, the original sounding "Don't Stop Now" has a style of music that is clear and classy and nothing personal, honey.  From happy faces, stars, and question marks to hearts, "That's What She Said" after "Aftershock" is a groove, and the best of three is last.  "It's a Love Thing" is so soft and sweet (drummer Jerry Angel) that the female fool looking for and finding changes rose up,On the whole the disc is profess-ional.  Once the licks are perfected, it becomes an inside good job.Contact: [...]
There are two things that you can never go wrong with, the playing of John O'Conor and the recording quality of Telarc. It is a shame that the Telarc label no longer exist. They left behind a catalog of some of the finest recordings ever.
This Highlights recording determined my purchasing the full length Mackerras version of the opera. I repeat the review posted there. Even though you'll have less of the opera with this, you will have one of the best highlights recordings available.Extremely happy with this recording, particularly, the conducting, which is lively and sharp-witted. The ensemble of artists too, is one of cohesion and relationships. The quality of sound is rich and performances are so good, that for a while I thought I was listening to a live performance, which is my favorite way to hear an opera.I don't think there is a perfect Don Giovanni, but this one comes close. There are no star-turns, no sanctimony, no hyper-reverential moments, just spirited Mozart, beautifully conducted and sung with great attention to character and story.
Do you like traditional music played on acoustic stringed instruments (guitar, mandolin, fiddle, dobro)? Then you'll find this CD is like your favorite comfort food -- with apple pie and ice cream for dessert. The musicianship, and songwriting, on this all-instrumental collection is outstanding. It includes one of my all-time favorite instrumental bluegrass tunes; but as a whole, it's not a bluegrass CD -- it's a category unto itself.
Megaherz, a German band from Bavaria, has gained a positive reputation in Europe - often compared to the big &quot;R&quot; - RAMMSTEIN.However, both the lyrics and melody are more refined - placing them more into the spectrum of the ONKELZ.  The album is a must for lovers of teutonic techno-metal. WER BIST DU is simply solid and all the selections are carefully recorded. I have to concur with one reviewer who stated that MEGAHERZ is everything music in America *should* be.If you like hard-hitting metal don't pass up this CD.  WER BIST DU is a headbanger's dream...
This unassuming budget classic reissue is among the finest of its genre: The Wagner orchestral highlight album, and features the contents of 1973 LP recital the farthest thing from run-of-the-mill, spaciously recorded with the palpable feeling of the presence of the musicians, not merely an amorphously gorgeous orchestral sonority.  The music unfolds without self-indulgent pointing, in a free-wheeling manner that is simply right.The original Ormandy program is supplemented with a track by Robert Shaw doing a luscious rendering of the famous Bridal Chorus from &lt;Lohengrin&gt; with his divine women's chorus, a version as good or better than any ever anthologized or appearing in complete opera recordings, its 1959 atmospherically recorded sound barely showing its age.My only caveat is that this stuff really merited more respectful packaging than this ersatz &quot;Best of&quot; series, but at the price, who should complain?

Well, I must admit my review is a little bias since I am a classical guitar enthusiast and a huge Bach fan.  Bream's playing of the lute suite in Em is beautiful.  This cd can serve as a nice background score while dining with your girlfriend, or as a technical performance heard with your headphones on, eyes closed, and full attention given.  If you love classical music and/or the sound of a clean acoustic guitar under the arm of someone who has mastered the art of the instrument, I highly recommend this!
The other reviewer must be a guitarist... Always preoccupied with technique and the like... Besides, the issue here isn't a performance (in which all performers have bad days...), but rather the recording! The point of this album is to present the music of Giuliani the way it was; hence the 1800's Stauffer copy guitar. The tone is very different from the standard &quot;Classical&quot; (Which is based on a the Spanish &quot;Torres&quot; guitars...) a bit lighter, not as much bass, a charming clarity. The performance is very well recorded and the music is very charming if you enjoy 1800's late classical/early romantic music. Some people have called Giuliani's music &quot;trite&quot; but, who are we kidding, not all music can be a Mozart or Beethoven, some of it must be a lighter/simpler character that reaches out to people not preoccupied with the most extravagant... Kind of like motorcycles; yeah, Race Replicas that go 160mph are cool, but the bike that you ride everyday and enjoy is much more far reaching and endearing, it grows with you in a way that this music does... I really enjoy this. Good for the real 1800's style and experience played with an impeccable touch!
When I lived in Washington DC, I used to treat myself, my fiancee and close friends to an evening listening to John Eaton practice his art at a piano-bar in Georgetown. The experience was always akin to attending a concert performance, only in a more relaxed setting.  This collection of Cole Porter and Hoagy Carmichael songs demonstrates Eaton's artistry as a jazz pianist and his loving and serious dedication to his work.  The last cut is a compelling, brilliant lecture by Eaton that evaluates Porter and Carmichael's contributions to American jazz and popular music.  Anyone who would dismiss Eaton as a mere cocktail lounge performer lacks an appreciation of his subtle genius and his musical elegance.  Musical snobbery is politically incorrect these days with musicians like Yo-Yo Ma introducing  a classically trained audience to the sound of Asian folk instruments in his Silk Road as well as to Argentine and Brazilian popular artists and their native instruments.
John Eaton represents the near-dead art of sophistication.  The melodies he plays are familiar, and he treats them with a respect befitting their worth.  Mr. Eaton plays in a style that demands very close inspection.  The subtleties he employs are more impactful than a virtuostic bombast of notes from other pianists.  Mr. Eaton is an incredible talent.  Support him and buy this CD!
Duke Chapel only have 3 organs in the Cathedral. Great recording.I am very lucky that I get to hear them in person
I bought this album on pure intuition, and have been hugely rewarded. It has a mixture of beatuful, well crafted songs and I constantly go back to listen and get something new out of it.I am eagerly awaiting their second album.
No one can approach this wonderful diva of the piano
It is a welcome development that more and more of Eleanor Steber's work from 1940-1960 is being reissued.  She was the greatest American soprano in her prime and too few of her complete opera performances were recorded.  People who listen to this collection are amazed, because opera lovers of today associate Steber with her voice of the 1970s instead of the glorious instrument heard on this disc. Dead-on Rossini and Thomas coloratura?  Sensual Massenet? Thrilling Puccini with breath control to spare?  It's all on this recording and I urge VAI and the owners of the original source material to put together volume 2 so we can rediscover more of this treasure.
First, it is a shame that the entire Sunset Serenade archives have not been presented as a box set. Since the recordings include all the chatter and the sound of Glenn Miller and Glenn's orchestra interacting with their audience, it allows one to understand the audience of teens and young adults complete with what they wanted; these recordings, even to a professional historian  such as myself, constitute a valuable insight into that bygone era. No number of recollections can substitute for actually hearing what people were doing.The sound is about 95 percent as good as the RCA Victor rereleases. It, very slightly, lacks the clarity of those releases, but one would have to be very demanding to be bothered by the fact that there is slightly less depth of sound and sparkle in these recordings.The music is superb. It is difficult to find fault with any of the individual cuts, but a few answer the question about whether the Miller organization, with its extreme emphasis on perfection, had become stale by 1941. On the newer arrangements-V for Victory Hop, for instance-the precision of the band and the excitement of the music demonstrates a muscularity and verve not always associated with Miller. (On "V-Hop" the sax section demonstrates something Miller alumni have pointed to--most Mlller recreations have the saxes play like, well, saxes-- while the reality is that the Miller sax section played LOUD. The solos on "V-Hop" are great, too) Even long-term standards such as "Volga Boatmen" come across as exciting and played with excitement. It may be that the interaction with the unusually young live audiences of the Sunset Serenade broadcasts gave an extra spark to the band.Miller also seems much more animated in bandstand presence than normal and his almost chatty style on these broadcasts allow one to understand why he could reach out to his audiences. Although Miller's reputation as a person has never been high, he comes across as not being as remote or as patronizing as some of the self-consciously serious bandleaders tended to be--Ellington comes to mind here. It may be true that no one ever went broke by underestimating popular tastes in the US, but Miller seems to have an empathy with his audience that such "popular/commercial" leaders as Kyser and Kaye never had. Indeed, these recordings allows one to parallel Miller with Populist artists such as Vachel Lindsay.So I recommend this strongly and take off one-half star simply because the recordings have not received the same quality remastering as a few other
Having heard sooo many children's CD's, this one stands out as being one of the best.  The songs, best suited for ages 3-6, are well chosen and well done.  My kids love listening to this CD, and I'm happy to listen, too.
This CD is great! What a varity of Cajun sound! Sounds a little old style, so I know you will love it! When I hear this, I wish crawfish season came more often.
The energy, melancholy, earthiness, spirituality, and rhythmic drive of Andean folk music are well represented in this collection.  I have owned the tape for over 25 years and was delighted to see that Amazon carried the CD.I was fortunate enough to have attended several performances of Tahuantinsuyo many years ago.  Their approach is fresh, enthusiastic, and heart-felt.  If you enjoy the music of the Andes, I highly recommend this CD.
This solo recording of the blind Catalan Jazz Pianist Tete Montoliu was recorded in 1980 at Boston University, Massachusetts. The first thing to say about these recordings is that Piano sounds very good for a live recording.Montoliu is a verstile Pianist, one minute he'll be playing in a modern idiom, and in next moment bluesy or then maybe bebop. My favourite track on this album is his great reading of Parker's 'Confirmation'; not the easiest tune to play as a solo Piano piece! Montoliu makes it seem very easy and part of the way through one of trademark change of styles occurs when he starts a walking 4 to the bar left-hand.The version of 'Giant Steps' on here has to heard to be believed, completely inspired. Starting off in sedate ballad form but rapidly changing through little Bach-like fugue and then picking up tempo into a phenomenal improvisation.Whatever he's playing Montoliu is a brilliant improvisor with technique in abundance. The rest of this solo concert is on a volume 1, which is perhaps not quite as good (but still brilliant). Treat yourself to one of the best ever European Jazz Pianists by buying this recording.
This is an outstanding CD because it contains extremely rare recordings by two of the most astonishing child prodigies of the violin in the early XX Century, who had an unusually short career and life. It covers the early recordings by Ginette Neveu (in 1938-39), and the complete recordings of Josef Hassid (in 1939-40).The French Neveu (1919-1949), had her first public performance when she was only five years old, and her "official debut" when she was seven. She started to accumulate first prizes, and in 1935, at the very first International Wieniawski Competition in Warsaw, she won first prize, at the age of 16. She immediately started performing in tours which took her to all corners of Europe, then the United States, Russia, Australia, and South Africa. The Second World War interrupted her career, which she began to pick up at the end of the war. Unfortunately, she died in an airplane crash in her way to the United States.The Polish Josef Hassid (1923-1950), had a shorter and more tragic career and life.  After showing unusual talent during his musical studies, he entered, as Neveu, the Wieniawski Competition in 1935, when he was only 12, one of the youngest among the 180 contestants. Despite his brilliant performance, he suffered a memory loss. But this did not overshadow his talent and gift, leading him to become a student of Carl Flesch, the Hungarian virtuoso, and many great violinists came to hear him play. Invited by Flesch to go to London, he made his recital as well as his orchestral debuts in April 1940. His final concert was in March 1941, after which he suffered from depression and other sever mental disorder. Some attribute this to a failed liaison with a young woman in Belgium. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in June 1941, and died in 1950 from complications of a brain surgery.In addition to their respective extraordinary talent and gift, Neveu and Hassid had many things in common: they started their careers extremely young; they entered the first Wieniawski Competition in 1935; they were students to Carl Flesch; their virtuoso performance ensured them very quick recognition; their recordings were very few and rare, and their career and life were tragically short.The CD is digitally remastered from the original 78 rpm discs. The quality of the sound is very good, but, understandably, not to be compared with current high quality recordings.  Its greatest interest is that it allows us to hear two outstanding young violinists who, if destiny had taken another course, would have become two of the greatest performers of all time.
This CD is amazing!! For all you freestyle freaks, this CD is for you.The song's are hot. "Distant Heart" by George Lamond, "Time passes by" by Safire, "4U" by Stevie B, and the list goes on. My favorite is from "The Original Cover Girl", one of the sexiest Freestyle diva, Angel Clivilles with "Dont tell me til Tomorrow". FREESTYLE LIVES!!!!!!!!!
Scott Tennant's playing on this, his first solo guitar recording, begins brilliantly with Mauro Giuliani's Grand Overture. While the Overture is  likely one of Giuliani's most mature compositions, the intensity of the  piece is magnified by Tennant's stunning use of the range of the guitar's  timbres and dynamics. This extraordinary playing continues throughout  Rodrigo's Sonata Giocosa. Tennant's masterful technique is especially  apparent in the third movement, for I've never heard a player approach the  movement's rasgueados (strumming) and quick scale passages with such  energy! The playing throughout the remaining pieces is also astounding. It  is to be commended.
Cabral is the greatest living exponent of the Portuguese guitar. His own compositions -- many of which include uncharacteristic dissonances, harmonies and structures -- break new ground for the instrument. This CD is a studio recording and has better sound than the other available releases. His live performances on FMS and Netwerk are also worthwhile but are out of print, so grab them if you get a chance. Be advised, however, that a lot of the same pieces appear on all three CDs.
Inge Borkh is one of the more fascinating dramatic sopranos of the 20th century; Salome is one of the strangest scores ever composed in the operatic repertory; the combination of these two things makes for a highly disturbing experience, as it should be in this opera.Borkh's Salome is a vicious, wheedling, spoiled monster from her very first utterance.  At no moment do you feel sympathy for this horrible adolescent.  The opera, in this case, has become about the over-powering sexual awakening of a headstrong, indulged and decadent teen-aged girl looking for religious epiphany in all the wrong places.Borkh often sacrifices tonal beauty (which she possesses in abundance when she chooses) and utilizes a nasal, piercing whine to spit out the more recitativo passages.  She and Max Lorenz (Herodes) both employ near sprech-stimme to convey the extremities of their characters' reactions to one another.  When the music gets really wild and fragmented both these singers descend into vocal dementia but never to the point of distorting the musical line or going over the top histrionically, but they get close.The strangeness of the score is accentuated by the sound quality of this release.  It was recorded live at the Munich Festival in July of 1951.  It takes a few seconds to adjust the ears away from expecting the usual clear fidelity and immediacy of current technology.  The orchestra sound is clear but comparatively thin, as if the listener were hearing it as the singers would hear it coming up out of the pit.  It isn't an anemic sound however.  It blossoms and roars when needs be but in the more sparsely scored sections certain instruments stand out vividly in contrast to the general rumbling and grumbling going on around them.  Instruments like the xylophone, timpani, cymbals and notably the horns stand out in high relief making for some odd sounds never noticed before but right there in the score.Joseph Keilberth is one of the great Salome conductors as it turns out.  I don't regret the limited dynamics in this case because the resulting whole is so eerie and makes my skin crawl over and over again as the situation worsens towards the end of the opera, ie Salome's getting more and more pyschotic leading up to her necrophilic ecstasy.Hans Hotter's St John is just as dangerous as Borkh's Salome, and their scene together at the beginning is psychologically gruesome.  The supporting cast is excellent whether they are singers you've ever encountered before or not.Inge Borkh is not an acquired taste, as some seem to think she is.  Her huge voice possessed a strong, fast vibrato but it was never a wobbler in my experience of her on record.  It could be argued that she had a judder (the steady vibrato) but it doesn't detract from the overall sensuousness of her singing, unlike Eva Marton whose juddering became almost like hiccups lined up in a row.  Borkh's  top notes gleam like titanium, and her middle and low voice, though more course than her top notes, are secure and easily penetrate the orchestra in its wildest rages.I forgot I was listening to a live performance, there was only one tiny cough noted from a silent (stunned) audience. It was more like witnessing a personal domestic meltdown that I wasn't supposed to see.  It was only when the audience erupts in roars at the end that I was pulled back from the tormented and private nightmare that had just played itself out.If you think Salome is one of the great masterpieces of the opera repertory (which it is) and are interested in Inge Borkh, Max Lorenz and Hans Hotter in these roles (and this is the only recording of any of them in these parts that I know of) then you will need to have this recording in your Salome library.If you love great threater this is a vivid memento of a great performance at Salzburg almost 60 years ago.
I am indebted to "Jack T." for the tip-off regarding this splendid live performance by Kubelik and the superb Bavarian Radio Orchestra in 1977.There are two potential caveats to get out of the way: first, you might, like me, not much like Peter Schreier's constricted tenor and you will have to accept the rather mushy, indistinct acoustic given to the choir, whose words and accents are indistinct. Nonetheless, I accept that Schreier sings most musically and sensitively and the soloists and orchestra are sufficiently forward to constitute no barrier to the listener's pleasure.Kubelik conducts an interpretation of white-hot intensity, daring to stretch the tempi of the Kyrie almost to stasis and then going hell for leather in the Gloria. His dedication is never in doubt and he carries his performers with him. Especially impressive is the radiant, soaring, silvery soprano of the great Helen Donath who sings fit to rival Janowitz for Karajan. Matching her is Brigitte Fassbaender, whose very different, firm, stentorian tones underpin the soprano line. John Shirley-Quirk's plangent, experienced bass is also an asset in the ensembles. At times, I find Kubelik's treatment of the chorales a tad foursquare but this is mostly a very grand but unbuttoned account.The sonic limitations notwithstanding, Orfeo have cleaned up their radio tapes very satisfactorily and there is no blare or distortion. This does not knock established classic version by Karajan, Klemperer, Bernstein and Giulini and or the historic 1953 recording by Toscanini off their respective perches but it joins them as a singularly stirring account, both thrilling and spiritual. I would value it highly for Donath's contribution alone, even if the other performers were not as impressive as they are.
I first heard this recording over public radio. I was surprised to find how much fuller "An der sch&ouml;nen, bluen Donau" Walzer when the chorus is added or not subtracted from the music.Of course everyone has a favorite and the first track even though the most popular is also my favorite. The other tracks make a good complement. There is not a klinker in the stack.As with books and movies, especially the listening of music, having knowledge of what you are listening to and the composer adds to the pleasure. This CD comes with a booklet telling the story ( in English and German) of the composer and information on each track.1. An Der Schonen, Blauen Donau, Waltzer, Op. 314By the beautiful blue Danube2. 'S Gibt nur a Kairstadt 'S Gibt nur a Wien, Polka, Op. 291There's only one Imperial City! There's only one Vienna3. Wein, Weib Und Gesang, Waltzer, Op. 333"Who loves not wine woman and song,Remains a fool his whole life long."4. Hoch Osterreich! Marsch, Op. 3715. Neu Wien , Waltzer, Op. 3426. Sangerlust, Polka Francaise, Op. 3287. Bei Uns Z' Haus, Waltzer, Op. 3428. Aufs Korn, Marsch, Op. 4789. Myrthenbluten, Waltzer, Op. 39510. Burschenwanderung, Polka Francaise, Op. 38911. Gross Wein, Waltzer, Op. 440
Some will like it, and some probably won't.  I heard one piece on the radio and decided I wanted the entire CD.  I'm glad I got it because it reminds me of Vienna, where I lived for a couple of years.  For anyone who likes Viennese music, I'd say this CD is a must.
Nicolas Flagello's work is &quot;modern&quot; but not too modern;  these pieces are basically tonal with just enough notes you don't expect to be exciting and stimulating.  I do not usually appreciate atonal music, but  here it seems just right.  I found myself humming the melodies at work --  even all the notes my untutored ears didn't expect!  Peter Vinograde a very  good-humored and laid-back man, and his performance on this CD reflects  that.  This music and its performance is infused with inspiring spiritual  and intellectual freedom.  Kudos!
Janos Starker is truly one of the great cellists of the twentieth century.  On this delightful collection of music for cello and piano from 1962-63, Starker is joined by frequent partner Gyorgy Sebok.  This disc is built around two compositions by Chopin -- the Sonata in G Minor (Op. 65) and the Polonaise Brillante (Op. 3).  Starker and Sebok blaze through both these pieces at a much quicker tempo than say Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax do on their 1992 Sony recording.  The result makes for interesting and exciting listening, but I prefer the more relaxed mood set by Ma and Ax.  The real gems on this album are lesser known, seldom recorded works by Mendelssohn, Martinu, Weiner and Bartok, not to mention the wonderful first Debussy Sonata.  In all, an excellent collection for cello enthusiasts.
Eastern pianists have been my heroes for as long as I can remember. It has taken me almost a decade of intensive research on the music of Chopin to learn that tender attachments to one's childhood heroes don't always serve music best; I've learnt that it's time to move on. In Penneys' recording of the Chopin Etudes there is a complete lack of Nazi-like control, which one hears often in others' Chopin Etudes; there is, rather, a sense of freedom -- the freedom to do it differently. Chopin is all about freedom.Dr Frederick de JagerPhD
Rather disappointed with the quality of thought gone into the one-star review by the particularly bitter and burnt sounding female Pom from Penn., I thought a respose was totally in order. With a statement like "totally wrong", you'd better say why. Or perhaps you think an "opinion" is enough in the world of Chopin? God forbid you've thought so little about this fascinating repertoire, rich for the real musician, listener and scholar! (As some of the reviewers have noticed). The only brainless things that unfortunately attach themselves onto R. Penneys' Chopin, are the unfortunate responses, of the like mentioned, that waste our reading time. This CD captures something about Chopin that was perhaps only caught in his day. If you don't agree, then you probably just don't know enough.Prelude.EP
I don't have the technical capacity to give this CD the honor it deserves. I came to it knowing little about Rubinstein, the Composer, and even less about Zora Mihailovich? All I can say is I find the recording, the compositions and the playing stunningly, stop me in my tracks, beautiful. The sonorities are right up there with Chopin, in my estimation. I have to wonder why this composer has been, if not neglected, then at least pretty well passed over by contemporary critics, concert organizers, etc. Yes, maybe there is a certain datedness to the music in some sense. Very Romantic and something one's grandma would have loved, but hey! I loved my gran and her piano playing (she excelled at ragtime, actually). This is perhaps the finest parlor (Scott Morrison would say "salon" perhaps?) music I have ever heard.As for Ms Mihailovich, she skips nor trips over nary a beat. I again plead ignorance in not knowing about previous recordings of these works, but if there is a better interpreter out there I would welcome emails of such. She is simply one of the most marvellously expressive pianists I have ever heard, and believe it or not, I've heard quite a few.Highly, unreservedly recommended to neophytes and hard liners, alike!BEK
This is part of a collection that ROCKS!!! ALL of these guys are raw,  snotty 60s punks who went to Sears, bought some axes, learned how to play  25 song, all of them &quot;Steppin' Stone&quot;!!!
This is a wonderful compilation of Shetland Island tunes done by two great fiddlers. I highly recommend this CD. It is well worth the purchase.
The music of Vadim Brodsky's violin is beautiful. His interpretation, superb.  The beauty of his playing fills your soul with longing. Let's bring him to America to play for all of us!!!!
It's rare to recommend a recording chiefly for its spoken narration, but Laurent Manzoni, taking on every part in Stravinsky's parable, is riveting. French is a language perfectly suited to Stravinsky's elegant, sec Champagne idiom, but Manzoni offers plenty of dramatic impact. Jean Cocteau is more cosmopolitan and ironic on the classic Markevitch recording (Philips), but this practically unknown performance rises to the top of the heap.Antonio Plotino is another unknown, but he leads the New Music Studium very well, lacking only the last measure of dramatic verve. However, the ultra-clear recorded sound is a big plus; we hear a virtual x-ray of Stravinsky's inventive chamber orchestration.  The same virtues apply to the filler, the great wind Octet, all the more welcome because most versions of L'Histoire du soldat have no fill-up at all.
Marianiello's performance in this CD is one of the finest flute works that I have listened to in my life. Her clean tone, beautiful phrasing, and mature interpretation are obviously astonishing. Music that she performes  is quite noble. Works by Gaubert, Widor, Lizst and Franck are standard  repertoire for the flute, and Marianiello's impeccable performance and her  passion are just idealistic for these master pieces. For those who only  know James Galway as a flutist, this is a chance to listen to one of the  finest artists today!
Don't let the kinda corny title throw you off. This is good stuff! If you are not familiar with bands like Majic Ship, Mystic Tide, Maze, The Zakary Thaks, then what are you waiting for? In my opinion, Gear Fab Records has issued a compilation that delivers a lot more punch than what most consider the ultimate psych comp. CD, Pebbles 3. This is true psychedelia from the sixties. Fuzz guitars, Farfisa organs and trippy lyrics. Some Airplane and Hendrix clones, but all the bands here have a unique sound and all can just downright play. Check out the innovative guitar work in Mystic Tide's "You Know It's True" or the rolling keyboards in Odyssey's "Churchyard." The CD ends with one of the best psych songs I've ever heard, Majic Ship's, "Life's Lonely Road." New interest in these bands has caused reissue of many of their albums and even some reunitings. Do yourself a favor and pick this up. The insert booklet has some very informative info, but more photos would of been nice. The sound quality is even fairly decent. This CD does not have the big names found on "Nuggets," but many bands here are very well known in the genre. Do yourself a favor, kick back, take an evening off, put the headphones, turn off the lights and listen! A musical trip awaits you.
I first heard and bought this album on vinyl back in the early 1960s.  It opened my eyes and ears to the connections between jazz (Hendricks was in the hit trio Lambert, Hendricks and Ross), gospel (check the killer version of "That's Enough" by Hannah Dean) and all forms of the blues, from acoustic to big-band.  I was too young to get into night clubs, and too far north to hear "race radio".  How else was I to know that Jimmy Reed, Little Richard, Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington were all part of one great family of American music?  Everything on here is still valid today.
This stereo recording of a 1982 concert performance powerfully conveys the tragic intensity of this supreme masterpiece (the composer himself, notoriously self-critical, said that this was his best work).  Compared to his celebrated 1960 DG stereo account, it is somewhat weightier and less driven, but no less intense.  Although the scherzo march does not possess quite the same degree of thrilling drive as the stereo DG (or on Pletnev's excellent budget priced recording on Virgin Classics as well), and the shattering climax of the first movement's development section is not, in my opinion, as powerfully shaped as in the earlier recording, the added breadth, weight and emphasis he applies here to the great climax of the final adagio makes it sound even more crushingly devastating.  Ideally, one should have both recordings.  Strongly recommended!
Thank you so much! My fave cd love it love it love it..... Brings back a lot of fun days
Received new and quickly from the seller.  Very pleased with the CD and with the prompt response given my order.
I have 15-20 CD,s like this &amp; it is among very best, as per the sample sounds
It's early Robison, perhaps not as refined as some later music, but very good just the same.  The songs contain excellent lyrics with a pleasing, slightly country style.  As with his other albums, this one has me listening again and again.
A friend gave me a tape full of music from Illapu including many of the selections from this album. I was so impressed with the musical precision and the energy and emotion conveyed through their music. This isn't in any  way amature, but is excellent music. The variety is excellent!I have had  this music for about 5 years now and have not tired of any of the tracks!
When I was in my late teens and early twenties and had been bitten badly by the classical music bug, two phenomena came together to make my explorations of music economically feasible across a wide range of repertory.  Vox began reissuing its enormous back catalogue, supplemented by new recordings, in cheap editions (remember the "Vox Box," three LPs in a boxed set for about ten dollars?); and the Nonesuch label also appeared in the bins.  Add to these cheap vinyl platters the marketing scheme represented in California by a retail franchise called The Wherehouse, which sold even the budget-price LPs at a further discount.  About when I was a senior in high school, the Santa Monica branch of The Wherehouse (then on Santa Monica Boulevard at Fourth Street) held a two-week sale during which the featured items were Vox and Nonesuch LPs at the "insane" (that was the advertising copy) low price of eighty-eight cents each!  I bought huge stacks of romantic orchestral music on Vox and lots of Bach, Mozart, and Haydn on Nonesuch.  The usual price for the same platters in those years was between two and three dollars.  This was around 1971 or 72.  Whatever woes currently afflict classical music recording, with Vox back in healthy business and with Naxos and Arte Nova continuing to make inroads, it is still possible to acquire an inexpensive collection of a wide range of classical music on CD.  Factoring in inflation, five-dollar tariff on a Naxos or Arte Nova CD means that it is probably cheaper than the three-dollar Vox or Nonesuch LPs of three decades ago.  All of which is a prelude to my recommendation of Stanislaw Skrowaczewksi's recording of Bruckner's Fifth Symphony, with the Saarbr&uuml;cken Radio Symphony Orchestra, on Arte Nova, part of that label's Bruckner cycle.  If the Eighth is the grandest in absolute terms of Bruckner's canonical nine, the Fifth is the most rigorous in its symphonic procedures.  Here the Bruckner of the three symphonic masses and the Te Deum, the Bruckner whose compositional roots lie in the eighteenth century, is in evidence.  The touchstone performances of this symphony come from Karl B&ouml;hm (1935), Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler (1942), and Otto Klemperer (1965).  These interpretations emphasize the colossal contrapuntal structures of the four movements and the tiered sound, more "organ-like" than in any other score by the arch-organist Bruckner.  Georg Tintner inaugurated his Bruckner-cycle for Naxos with the Fifth and, by all critical accounts, less persuasively that he might have.  No such disappointment can be lodged against Skrowaczewksi, who understanding of the score and deliberation in the performance are of the highest order.  Two or three years ago, Tahra issued a massive performance of the Fifth given by long-time Brucknerian Eugen Jochum with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1983.  Critical commentary rightly extolled it.  But this inexpensive one-CD edition is every bit as good as the expensive two-CD Tahra set.  The strings shimmer, the woodwinds glow, the brass come on like molten metal in the coda of the Finale.  A great Bruckner 5 for beginners or a great addition to a mature Brucknerian's CD-shelf.  Recommended.
really kool techno/electronica tunes! great songs by orbital &amp; the prodigy! definetly check this 1 out, if your just getting into this kind of music!!!
If you have ever wanted the perfect compilation of techno and electronica tunes ever put into a movie you have just found it. Hackers the Soundtrack has top name artists on it and has yet to diappoint anyone who has heard  it. If you have seen the film all the songs will be automatically  recognisable. The two brightest jems are both by the Prodigy &quot;Voodoo  People&quot; and &quot;One Love.&quot; Indulge your C.D. player and buy  this album and crank it. Rock the planet baby!
