I was looking for a concert, not instructions to play his songs. A total waste of money. It should have said that it was for instruction.
This was terrible. It gets right to the part you need to know to solder the pickups and then cuts and shows pickup already installed. I really dont see how anybody approved this for sale. If you are looking to learn how to install pickups and save yourself money at the guitar store - this DVD is worthless. Again, the video footage cuts ahead at the critical point that would show you which wires to solder where. so disgusted.
I purchased this item for my son's birthday. It indicated that it was a brand new item. When we opened the package, the DVD was scratched and it appeared used. I did not bother to follow up with the seller. I'm not ordering from them again. That's deceiving to advertise an item as brand new, wrap it nice and neatly to sell-- when opened it was very obvious that this was a used item. Not sure how they can get away with doing that. When my son watches the DVD, there are parts of it that freezes up. Horrible product and advertisement. I wouldn't recommend ordering from them since there is no way to know if they are telling the truth about their products being new. Sad thing is that my son wants to get other screaming dvd...if I decide to get it, I won't purchase from this seller.
Love the movie, I watch it every Christmas.  Somehow, when ordering this, I missed or it was omitted, that it was for European DVD players only.  Won't work on the players made for the American market.  I wish it would have been clearer when I ordered it.
It's a sad commentary on the state of political correctness when a book written in the 19th century has to be &quot;updated&quot; instead of being preserved as a precious reminder of times gone by. Are filmmakers so concerned with the bottom line that they don't think viewers are capable of recognizing a historical setting for what it is? The virtue of the novel is in its message - that love is eternal, surpassing youth, beauty, and riches. What part of that message can't be understood by a modern audience without &quot;sanitizing it for our protection&quot; against mores of bygone days? Why must we be hit on the head with the Anvil of Political Consciousness in a story where those notions had yet to be brought to the fore?If the people making this movie had been truly interested in finding feminism in Louisa May Alcott's text, then they missed the boat in three enormous ways:1. They made Jo the prettiest girl. That casting move left all of her lines about being an awkward tomboy sound as if she were fishing for compliments. What would have been so terrible about having someone less model-waif-starlet take the role? Go back and watch June Allyson and Katherine Hepburn in their turns as Jo - they weren't prettied up by the makeup artists and photographers, and it makes them all the stronger. By making Jo so lovely, the film accidentally moves against feminism by falling into the stereotype that even &quot;little&quot; women have to be beautiful. (To be fair, they also make Professor Bhaer unrecognizably handsome, missing the point for the male as well as female characters.)2. They ignored the subtle textual references about Marmee having as severe a temper as Jo. Instead of showing Marmee shouting out a window about not wearing corsets, why not show her working to control her emotions for the good of her family? Why not show her desire to work for the betterment of the poor as an outlet for her frustration over being left at home? Can you imagine what Susan Sarandon could have done with material like that?3. I'll grant that it would be hard to portray the changes in Amy, because in the novel most of them are happening in description rather than in her actions. Simply changing actresses in mid-stream isn't enough - we should have seen her growth from inside, her desire to become a good person rather than a rich one. Instead of seeing Laurie as her just reward for having made such a difficult journey, as we do in the book, it comes across as irony that someone so selfish should wind up with the rich boy next door.Thanks, but no thanks - I'll go back to Katherine Hepburn or June Allyson (even though in the latter version it's obvious Joan Bennett was pregnant when she portrayed Amy), and take my message undiluted.
I was so excited to purchase my copy of this film because it's one of my favorites.  But it won't play.  It won't play in any American DVD player.  That's something that should have been advertised.
This vendor is terrible.  Nothing happened after the order, do not answer the emails either.
It is with great reluctance that I write this review. I have waiting and soul searching long and hard to find the appopriate words to fit. I anticipated this movie with great enthusiasm as it was heralded as the next best thing since the wheel all over hollywood. When the reviews came in I was pushed even further in my reverie. Then came the nominations, and I was certain this was 'the one.' I was sadly incorrect in my assumption. This picture is well acted and the cinematography is breath taking. However, it is only a reminder that gay people never get a happy ending in hollywood and even has the nerve to go way beyond that. (Tip: If you have not seen this picture stop reading now as I will reveal the ending.) Ang Lee is a very creative director and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are both extremely good actors. Let me get that out of the way right now. There is a line in a movie called "The Boys In The Band" that states 'not all faggots get bumped off at the end of the story.' Unfortunately that is not the case here. Although this is my opinion, the money spent on this disaster could very well have been put to better use. There is no reason whatsoever the lead character has to be brutally murdered in such a violent fasion. Nor was there a reason the scene had to be so long and graphic! There is an entire generation of young people that left the theater or removed this DVD from their home systems thinking this was status quo. That gay people DO always get killed violently, or worse, deserve it. It saddens my heart to think that somewhere a teenager who does not know any better has begun to beleive it! I realize this picture is depicting an era of time where things like this actually did happen. We have, however, come a long way since then and opinions have changed dramatically. We are no longer categorized as sick twisted individuals who must come to a brutal violent ending. There was a simple fix to this: Jakes character could easily have moved to another state and the two men just not see each other anymore. Not in Hollywood dear. It seems the powers that be insisted on the murder, and that is what you are left with. What a tragedy. I lived through the violent years of being gay myself, and am very proud of the struggles and progress we have made. This picture has thrown the gay rights movement back thirty years. The reason I am writing this review is because many people beleive what they read or see or hear. It is with my sincerest hope that this may help someone realize.....it isn't always like it happens in plays or in this case a hollywood movie. There is more to life. I have since thrown out my DVD and the book for fear if I donate it to a library or sell it, it would do more harm than good. Perhaps someday Hollywood will get this right......It just wasn't with this one.
Utterly objectionable - and not for the reasons you'd think.  Vito Russo's classic The Celluloid Closet exhaustively details how Hollywood films time and again deliver the same message about the fate of anyone who engages in "the love that dares not speak (or in the case of Ennis Del Mar, mumble) its name."  The heterosexual norm can only be maintained if gay lovers either die or end up miserable and alone.  Sound familiar?  Brokeback Mountain is hardly any different than outdated films and books such as The Children's Hour, The Victim, The Well of Loneliness or even Cruising -all of which scholars agree remain interesting primarily as documents of society's antiquated and harmful views of homosexuality.  Then there's the gay "esthetic" of the movie:  a cinematic rendering of the pathetic "straight-acting, no fats, no femmes" personal ad, with more than a touch of sanitized Advocate Men fantasy fiction thrown in for good measure.  I thought the real low point came about 3/4s the way through the movie when Jack, rebuffed by Ennis, goes to a third-world, film-noirish Mexico to seek out furtive, shadowy sex on what seems to be a leftover set from Touch of Evil.  The year is roughly 1978.  Yes, the height of the disco era.  I guess a weekend in L.A. or Dallas would have out of the question for him.  At this point the movie has its heels so firmly planted in the recidivistic 1950s celluloid closet of its own making, there's simply no hope.  The movie does raise some interesting questions however:  Were there any gay people involved in the scripting or making of this film?  Were there really no gay actors available to play these parts?  (Doth I protest too much?  Ask yourself this question:  how would the public react to a movie about two inner city black girls that was written by Ben Stein and acted by Paris Hilton and Gwyneth Paltrow....)  Leaving us finally to deal with message of the movie's sub-plot:  closeted gay fathers - in their quests to remain eternal Peter Pans - pose a threat to the institutions of family and marriage.  I can't imagine a message we need less right now in America!  The hype machines have been in overdrive about how this is a "mainstream" gay film where "A-list" heterosexual actors, writers, authors, etc. are "unafraid" to openly address gay issues.  Doesn't that sound suspiciously like kind of self-interested condescension that led recording artists in the `50s with nothing of their own to say to cover the hits of Ray Charles and Little Richard to "sanitize" them for white ears?
This movie was so boring that I was falling asleep in the theater and my boyfriend had to pinch me to keep my head up.  I can't believe this movie is being called Oscar worthy?!?!?!  I've seen better [...] movies than this.  This movie was nothing new, just basically the same sad plot about two men falling in love ending in tragedy and sadness.  YAWN.  Boring.  Whatever.  Michelle Williams was the only interesting character to me, but beyond that, I am pretty sure I won't be buying this on DVD or bother watching it again.
This was billed as The Gay Cowbay Movie, referred to that way endlessly on all month.  Much to my shock and dismay, these were not cowboys at all, but sheep herders.  Leave it to Hollywood to not get the significant difference.  After the first half hour, I fled from the theatre mortified.  If you want to see a real good, funny movie about sheep herders, see if you can find a copy of The Sheepman starring Glenn Ford, Shirley MacLane, and Leslie Nielsen.
i saw this movie and found it boring and it seemed to drag on too long for me. i must say that this is the only movie that i've ever watched all the way through that i actually jumped and cheered when it was over.
Come January 23, Brokeback Mountain gets the much awaited 2-disc collector's edition dvd release. Sadly the new edition has very little to offer. Being a 2-disc collector's set, so much was expected from this edition...But all its got is a new DTS track and just 2 new featurettes, including "A groundbreaking success" (which I'm sure, as the title suggests, is nothing more than the people involved, appreciating each other), Music from the mountains (obviously only about the music) and an art gallery of still images!! Other than these, all the features from the previous release will be available on the disc which barely run for 45 minutes.Being such a groundbreaking and talked about film, at least a Director's Commentary was expected for a special edition like this...Sadly its missing. Also, no real meaty extras here to give any in-depth look at the making of the film or the impact the film had. Maybe they've saved all these for a triple-dip in the future.Sadly, being a big fan of the film, it was a long wait which ultimately ended in a huge disappointment. Few collectible cards and meaningless, weightless extras, is not what I was looking for in this edition...it was much, much more than that!Its time, Universal realised that the fans are really pissed off with this upcoming extremely poor edition and delayed the release, to add some real special features on the discs.
I did not care for it thu some of friends liked it I can not believe that someone in Texas would be so crazy to make so many mistakes that he did. any gay man in Texas knows enough to make sure that all of his tracks are covered
I went into this film with the mindset that it was going to be moving and interesting and an overall great film.  I however found it boring and pointless.  I would like to know how these two fell in love.  I would have liked to see more of the emotions that compelled these two reluctant men to form a relationship.  I was left with just random mumblings.  I have not read the story, but I'm thinking it is probably much better than the film.  I can see that there was a good story to be told within, but it was just not explored.  I am sorry this movie wasn't what it could have been.  I don't recommend it.  Obviously it found its fallowing, as there are 100s of wonderful reviews out there.  This however is not one of them.
After all the hype about this movie I guess I set my expectations too high. I was expecting "an epic love story" like the trailers and reviews tout it to be. I don't remember anywhere in the entire film the word "love" being mentioned. Ennis and Jack certainly never said it... to each other or to their wives or their kids. I was expecting to watch these two guys unexpectedly fall madly, head over heels, kick up your boots, thank your lucky stars in love with each other. What I ended up watching was two drunks get it on `cuz they were horny and didn't have anything else to do between shootin' coyotes and tacklin' sheep. Then they spend the rest of their miserable lives cheating on their wives, abandoning their kids, and arguing about why they should or shouldn't make a life together. Undoubtedly the sense of longing to be together was conveyed, but for what? Love? Sorry, none to be had here.The only redeeming quality of this film is that the scenery is stunning; however, the acting was average. I never felt emotionally attached to anyone except Michelle Williams's character, Alma. My personal opinion is, if you think you might be gay; don't expect getting married to a woman to fix it. You simply ruin your life, her life and the lives any kids that are created in the process. I left the theater with an extreme sense of emptiness.I had hoped that somewhere in this wretched mess that someone would end up with a scrap of happiness. However, the best they could do was to have Alma Jr. to get her daddy to come to her wedding. So much for resolution.I was told by a friend, "Life doesn't always have a happy ending..." I'm a gay man in the 21st century; if I want to experience life, I don't think I Ang Lee's help to do it.
I was really glad that BROKEBACK didn't win Best Picture.  The more I think about this movie, the more I think it's actually a very BAD movie, both politically and artistically.  First of all, it reinforces all sorts of negative stereotypes about gay men (they prey on and lure straight men into their way of life and ruin marriages and are promiscuous and are ultimately lonely and pathetic and/or die of AIDS or are bashed to death).  Secondly, it's not about love, it's about animal lust done by two incredibly selfish men who, if the story were straight, would have had feminist groups up in arms in anger.  Finally, it is yet another gay movie about beautiful men who don't exist in real life for anyone outside of those with lots of money who can afford the gym bunnies of west Hollywood.I didn't see CRASH, but I assume it was at least not self oppressive and ugly.
First of all let me clarify, I hated this movie because it was a bad movie.  I have no homophobic feelings, whatsoever.  The kiss between Jack and Ennis when Michelle Williams first sees them is a wonderful scene.I just thought this movie went haywire from the beginning.  First, it was horribly and strangely miscast.  Sure, Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams are compelling and turn in sound performances, but the rest of the cast was completely misplaced.  Jake Gyllenhall isn't a cowboy, he is a great actor, but every one of his scenes was laughable due to his and my uncomfort with him playing a cowboy.  Anne Hathaway was in the movie, I guess, to dye her hair every other scene.  And let me point out the other strange casting . . . Randy Quaid and Anna Farris??Secondly, while the movie may have been a political victory, maybe they should have focused on making it a film victory.  Ang Lee is a horrible story teller.  All his movies jump around incoherrently and in this case sometimes creepily (the scene where Ennis goes to visit Jack's parents still gives me nightmares.)  He has a spectacular eye and the cinematography is great, as is the soundtrack, but the directing and the script are a mess.Finally, and this is the most important point, (SPOILER) Jake Gyllenhall's death is just another part of the obnoxiousness of this movie.  Yes, it is sad they couldn't share their love to the world.  Yes, it is sad that people attack people just because of their sexuality, but watching Jack get attacked with a tire iron screamed CLICHE!  I wanted to vomit.  It was at that point that I was really just watching the same old love story, like Titanic, without a boat.  Who cares if they are two men . . . the love story is a typical one, and that why it was so easy for so many to swallow.  This is nothing that Guess Who's Comming to Dinner or West Side Story or Say Anything wasn't, the only thing that makes it worse than those movies . . . it isn't clever of cutting edge or worth the two and a half hours.I give this movie a very vehemet one star!
I can't begin to summarize this movie.  The plot was so boring; I can't believe I didn't fall asleep during the film.  I didn't even understand a word Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were saying.  They were mumbling.  At the beginning of the movie, the setting was beautiful, but as soon as a word was spoken, everything went downhill.  Anne Hathaway played a good part.  Her role progressed as the movie went on.  Yes, there are a couple sex scenes with Gyllenhaal and Ledger, but it was totally pointless.  They weren't even gay in the movie.  They just wanted sex; didn't matter from who.  This movie also stars Linda Cardellini (Velma from Scooby-Doo 1 and 2) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1, 2, 3, and now 4).  I couldn't believe it when I saw Anna Faris.  When I saw her I'm like `is that the girl from Scary Movie?'  Same comment for Linda Cardellini.  I really expected more from this movie, but instead I was very disappointed.  I just can't believe this got nominated for an Oscar.
Did anybody honestly believe that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was going to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards last month?Come on, this is a business.They may pick films that most of the country will never see but they're not going to pick a controversial film that'll jeapordize any box office revenue.  The media was focused on the hysterical rage of the gay community that flared up when CRASH was announced as the winner but you could also see the collective sigh of relief filling the auditorium when Nicholson called something other than BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.Despite all the hype and the huge media push, in spite of all the blogs and message boards where gays brag about inflating the box office by seeing the movie a half-dozen times a week (or weekend), I don't think America wants to see this movie.  I live in a blood Red state filled with cowboys and NOT A ONE wanted to see this movie.It's about gay sheepherders.  Or they think they're gay sheepherders, although they keep telling each other they're not.  One wife finds out they're gay...but she doesn't say anything (that's in a perfect world, folks, because I've known wives who found out their husbands were gay and it was a cross between Jerry Springer and Armageddon.  Think about it: would the wives be so understanding if their hubbies were bunking up with a cowgirl?).The movie would've been more interesting if the two cowboys HADN'T been gay but everyone else THOUGHT they were.  They continue on their fishing and riding trips over the years and their families are gossiping and snickering while nothing sexual is happening between them.As it is, re: the fate of these two guys, I was waiting for Monty Python's Church Police to show up and "arrest Society...since society's to blame!"  It's like the Matthew Sheperd crime: nobody cares what someone does, just don't go hitting on drunken rednecks.And I'm still not ready to completely forgive Ang Lee for ruining THE HULK.
Worst movie ever, waste of money, couldn't finish it, should b vaulted, disappointed, want my money back, too darn slow.
What was billed as a step-by-step breakdown of Black Sabbath's guitar styles and techniques is little more than anyone could pick up in an afternoon just by listening to the record. I bought the DvD for two songs - The Wizard and Wicked World - thinking that I would "learn the trademark riffs and SOLOS", as stated on the back. I thought maybe I could see some of the fingering Iommi does on some of his wilder sounding riffs and solos.Well, for The Wizard, all you get is the opening chord riff and the verse. None of the breaks, no solos, nothing. I learned those parts back when I was 15 and barely able to play at all. For Wicked Word, a little more than that is offered. Anything involving REAL chops is not shown. I am wondering if Danny Gill can really play. What a waste of $18!
I think the girls are tired of shouting and rock in the firt album.this one is very boringtotally different from the first album
This band needs to get exposure again. Solid Dixie and band music. Bob's vocals are soothing and do not copy his brother. He just comes across as a nice guy!
This is a very poor quality CD. I have never taken the time to complete a review for Amazon previously - this item becomes the exception because it is so very bad. The sound quality is so poor it is not a CD that allows for easy listening. I have a large collection of older blues recordings so I understand that the recording may be far less than perfect yet still be appropriate for the time and genre. My guess is that this CD was produced by playing a very scratchy, old record and then used cheap recording equipment to burn the CD.
The performance is just fine, but Amazon has mis-described the product.  Mozart's Violin Concerto Number 1 is NOT in D Major; it is in B Flat, not D Major.  Violin Concerto No. 1 is B-flat major, K. 207 (1775)).  This CD contains instead the Violin Concerto in D, KV271i, which is probably NOT by Mozart.  See, for example,  [...]
It is 1984. In the Oval Office, Ronnie is using the suitcase that could unleash Armageddon as a pillow. Fashion-wise, the excesses of the Seventies have mutated into monsters whose fame lingers to this day. More critically, a Hard Acetic Rain is lashing the landscape of classical music and carrying all before it. In London, the Masters of the Squeeze Box - the Salomon Quartet - gather furtively in a London studio to drain the blood from K 581 to the glory of their ideology.Ignore the imprimatur of the Penguin Guide and the glossy booklet itself: this is hideous. True, Alan Hacker plays with considerable mastery but not enough to expiate the vampiric excesses of his accompanists. It epitomises all the horror of Period Practice Generation I: the bulges in the melodic line, the clipped phrasing and the repudiation of tonal beauty. Bugger gut-strings: in this instance the Salomon Quartet somehow used live cats to eke out their 'umble contribution: meow, meow, meow, meow - meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow (which is my transcription of the opening bars of the first movement).A comparison of Hacker with Anthony Pay is not to the advantage of the former (Mozart Clarinet Quintet Horn Quintet Oboe Quartet). While Pay also comes in train with the Vinegar Express, the greater poignancy he evokes in the Larghetto and the latter variations of the final movement is exculpatory in itself.It is said that Richard Strauss spent his last days with a score of the Clarinet Quintet. If he had heard this wretched, anchored-in-time performance, it would have been a precursor to Purgatory.Avoid unless you like cat wauling.
This is not Sibelius No.1....in fact I don't know what it is.  The writeup talks about Sanderling........avoid it unless you recognize the music.......
If there is one outtake from Jesus' Parable of the Talents, it's this: whatever your allocation might be - five, four or even one talent - you must produce yield. Stagnation is damnationAs a singer, Shura Gehrman has less than one talent to his name and even that is contestable. His part-ownership of Nimbus underwrites his discography. With malice towards none, he's the male equivalent of Florence Foster Jenkins, not least in exuberance. His voice - and I say this as nicely as I can - is ghastly; much the same could be said of his technique, insofar as it can be identified with any certitude (his breath-control is suggestive of emphysema or an intensive burst on the exercise-bike before the recording sessions). His German is unidiomatic - is this retribution for Barbarossa? What is he? Basses and baritones, tenors and counter-tenors: one and all want to disown him; he is woeful across the spectrum: no sweet-spot is identifiable. Worst of all, he shrieks at anything beyond forte. Listen, for instance, to Der Atlas: it's is enough to scare the bejesus out of Uncle Fester. Schubert told his friends that Winterreise is an exercise in terror. Here, his words come true. Not one syllable is left upon another. This is annihilation into sub-atoms with no prospect of resurrection.The fate of Joe Dirt is salutary. Gehrman could have sat around counting his roubles or doing burn-outs in the Walmart car-park or brewing his home-beer or bedding bimbos with big norgs. Perhaps he did these things too. Nevertheless, he courted disdain and infamy by performing these masterpieces with his half-talent voice. For reasons that the Russian Count may not appreciate, his legacy will endureth forever. Honour is his. Come Judgement Day, it may not go awry with him. That does not mean you have to endure these abominations.  Note their existence and move on lest you add to the gnashing of teeth in the dark.
I agree. there is enough porn out there. I don't want to find it without looking for it..or my kids. CHANGE THE ALBUM COVER. PLEASE !!!
The good--Scotto's interpretation creates a believable character and Pavarotti sings in his pre-superstar, not-overblown manner (remember, this is a good thing) The bad--Scotto runs out of breath at the end of 'Caro  Nome' and we fear her survival (vocally, that is) in almost every scene.  This recording wins the award for 'Worst Performance by a Major Opera House  Chorus.'  The recorded sound is variable in volume and balance (Giulini's  conducting doesn't help matters) and the smaller roles are taken by timid  or incompetent singers.  The ugly--too bad our Rigoletto here, Kostas  Paskalis, wasn't recorded under better circumstances.
"Explode Together" collects two dub recordings made of XTC material-- the "Go+" EP and Andy Partridge's solo dub release, "Take AWay / The Lure of Salvage".  I've got some dub stuff in my collection, so while I'm by no means an expert, I think I can discuss this was some authority.  The idea behind the music is to essentially create remixes by cutting and pasting elements of a song to emphasize the rhythm parts and remixing to get a fatter bass sound.  Most dub, particularly the less well formed stuff, ends up sounding like a programmed drum beat, a big bassline, and what sounds like occasional samples from something.  At its best, it can be highly engaging, at its worst, it can be mind numbingly dull.Unfortunately, this one tends to drift closer to the latter than the former, particularly the material on "Go+".  Mostly its drum beats that detracted from their originals sound rather dull ("Beat the Bible") and largely uninspired arrangements ("We Kill the Beast").  The only piece that's remotely salvagable on here is "Clap Clap Clap", where Partridge clearly had a field day in the studio, laying all sorts of effects on the lilting rhythm track.  "Take Away / The Lure of Salvage" is slightly (SLIGHTLY) better, covering a much wider range of sounds, unfortunately some of them qualify as dull a listen, just in a different way ("Shore Leave Ornithology" sticks way out, and at nearly six minutes long, it can drive you mad, even if the honking sax at the end is intriguing enough).  Some of the pieces do pick up some interesting elements (the freak guitar noise on "Steam Fist Futurist" for example and most of "Rotary"), but by and large, even these pieces are pretty forgettable.I realize a lot of XTC fans find a way to love these recordings, but quite honestly, this is one that stays filed away in the collection-- it's not good enough to justify repeated listens.  If you're a completionist, you probably already have it or will get it regardless of what I'm saying, if you really love dub, maybe it's worthwhile, but anyone else would be well advised to steer clear.
I must say I was very disappointed with the recording quality of this disk - and no, it was not my equipment that was faulty
I purchased this DVD That Latin Sound by Edmundo Ros and am very disappointed.  I got it for my son for Father's Day as he enjoys Latin music.  Edmundo Ros's voice was awful.  His voice has totally gone and whilst my son was listening to it, he  said he had to turn it off.I wish there was some way we could listen to some tracks before buying music.
I bought this HDCD based on the fact that it is an HDCD, I like Dowland, and original instrument recordings.  The first cut is fantastic.  However, each to their own, the next two vocal cuts are not to my tastes.  The engineering seems to be heavily "tweaked" to cover for quality of the vocalist and this severely hurts the sound of the excellent instrumentalists who would have been better off without the vocalist, IMHO.  I couldn't bear the thought of listening to any more of the album.Too bad, because it had excellent promise.
These would be serviceable performances were it not for the fact that there is absolutely no bottom to this ensemble! I'm sitting here with the scores of these two symphonies in hand, and the double basses are simply not there! Neither are the celli, the violas, the bassoons or clarinets. The only instruments with any presence at all are the 1st (not the 2nd) violins, the horns and the trumpets. The rest are lost in a blurry mush that is so unfocused as to make these performances, whatever other merits they might have had, essentially worthless. Trust me, you have absolutely no idea of what you're NOT hearing here. If you only knew, you'd want your money back. Avoid these like the plague!
I have never in my life heard a more unprofessional recording.  High school groups have produced more rhythmical and in-tune recordings than Eton has with this CD.  I am grossly disappointed that a musician of this  poor quality can release his own CD, and I am even more shocked that the  American public cannot hear the difference between music of high quality  and this garbage.  Maybe the American public should reacquaint itself with  good music before writing any more reviews.
Bought it for the song Gloria.  Only song worth listening to, in my opinion.
This CD is in something called SACD format.It will NOT work on a standard CD-player.Otherwise, sorry for the 1-star rating, just a warning. On almost every CD player on the market you will be listening to the sound of silence.
I honestly must admit... Mr. Banaszak is one of the worst saxophonists I have ever heard.  I am currently majoring in saxophone performance and music education, and looking back, most of the saxophonists in my high school band (believe me they were nothing spectacular) are better than Banaszak.  For starters, his tone is too bright and his vibrato makes it hard to tell if he's actually in tune or out of tune.  Frankly, I agree with the other reviews that say he sounds like a bleating nanny goat.  He also tends to get drowned out by the orchestra a lot.  His interpretations are disgustingly boring and very middle schooler-ish.  I struggled through the entire cd, and I haven't heard a single staccato note.  His lack of articulation contrasts were especially clear in the Ibert and the Glazounov.  In the first fast run in the Glazounov, he slurred the entire thing, which is marked slur two tongue two, then slur fours, then slur eights.  He also had trouble establishing a beat, especially on the first movement of the Ibert.  I his playing to be quite less than par, and I prefer to listen to my cd of Dr. Eugene Rousseau playing these pieces.  Other good recordings of these can be found by Dr. Lawrence Gwozdz, Marcel Mule, Sigurd Rascher, and numerous other fine saxophone artists.  DO NOT BUY THIS CD!  I'm glad I didn't spend money on it, I rented it from the library here at school!  YECH!
This is NOT what I expected at all. I simply wanted a cd with the sounds of a rain storm...that's it. I didn't expect to get some cheesy music played very poorly. You can barely hear the rain over the music. The CD states that it's &quot;Rain Storms: Sounds of Nature.&quot; Any person should be able to safely assume this does not include music. I guess I assumed wrong. Don't buy this.
Had this been all rain - like advertised (nowhere does it say music), my rating would have been much better. Ugh, ugh, ugh on the music. This is a MUSIC CD, not a rain strom CD.
Seriously. What a total rip off!!!  $50 for 2 pairs of drum sticks!!!! And then $12 for shipping!! Even though they are sized for youngsters, they aren't even worth 1/4 of what they are being sold for. All I can think is that they are up here for grandmas who don't know any better to buy for birthdays and christmas at a ludicrous markup. Shame on this merchant.Want sticks for kids? Get these:Vic Firth Kidsticks
If you buy this product it's because you didn't research anything else.  If you want to edit audio final cut can do a better job than sound edit.  If you want MIDI than get Performer or emagic logic for between 3 bill and a 1000$.sound edit is antiquated and has very limited function.
Docked one star for repeating the same mistake he made with Hogs In Wolfs Clothing. Both these releases should have been stellar because McPhee, in the same breath as Rory Gallagher, John Mayall, and Peter Green is one of the kings of British blues rock, and paying homage to one of his heroes should be a pleasure, not a chore to listen to. Intead, Muddy Waters Songbook is even more uninspired than it's predecessor, and sounds like it was recorded on the budget of a teenage local band doing their first demo. The guitar sound is unbelievably weak, the entire band just sounds like they want to get it over with. Such a shame that a talent like TS McPhee has been reduced to putting out this type of junk. Don't waste your money on this stuff.
I'm sure this CD would be quite good if you could play it. I received two, and they were BOTH totally unplayable with almost every song skipping and totally stopping. I think Amazon got taken by whatever schlock outfit recorded this thing. Not wanting to go through the hassle of sending it back still a third time, I just sucked it up and lost the "dinero". So be prepared if you order this, or better yet, order something other than this dud.I wanted to rate this NO stars, but that didn't register. THAT is however my rating.
... i would have walked out at intermission. I can't really guess what Boccherini had in mind for these flute/oboe quintets -- something graceful and evanescent, I'd imagine -- but the current ensemble, the Auryn string quartet plays with blunt indifference to aesthetic delicacy , and the flute of Michael Faust resists any sort of integrated ensemble timbre. It's harsh, shrill, tinny, and breathy throughout, more a signal whistle than a musical instrument. By all means, don't judge the music of Luigi Boccherini on the basis of such an unstylish recording! Get the"Ensemble 415" recording of Boccherini's String Quintets with two violas, released on 'musique d'abord.'
I happen to be a serious Victor Wooten fan. But, I watched a few minutes of this tape in a music store and was, well, bored. It is more or less a tape of Vic's experiences in the studio. Which, to be honest, if you've  ever did studio work, you know can often be like, uh, boringggggg  !They should have taped much more playing and much less talking.  Save your money and buy any one of Vic's other tapes.
These are not re-mastered or re-issued.  They are just not the originals.
Another online store had this clearanced for $9.99, so I bought it to play tapes at night for my infant.  The bonus was that my 3-year-old discovered he loved singing along with the microphone (during the day, of course)!  I thought it was handy that there was a separate volume control for the mic.  Unfortunately, less than a year after purchasing this player, the &quot;play&quot; button on the top-loading cassette broke unexpectedly when I pushed it ... I guess it's not made to be pushed once a night.  The concept on this is great, but the quality was not up to most electronics companies' standards.
I bought these thinking they were going to play a musical note when you bang them on a surface.  They are just hollowed out plastic tubes that sound like a paper towel roll when you bang them.  These are a fraud.  Don't waste your money.
Ordered these online based on reviews and all the hype. They were a big disappointment - didn't sound like musical instruments at all. Sent them back the same day.
I bought this for my son who will use it at school.  This recorder does not have correct tones. Its fa and sol are completely off.  I have to purchase another one but it won't be a Yamaha.
I first played the C40 last year. It was a great guitar for the money. I ordered one last month. To my dismay, I noticed that the new C40 was manufactured much differently. Apparently, the quality has gone way down. Not much tonal quality. Not much volume. Higher action. Perhaps this was a bad factory run, but I was disappointed. This played like a different guitar.
Crap.  Doesn't work.  Wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period.  Plastic junk, never did get a good signal.  The worst Sony item I've ever purchased -- and I'm a Sony fan.  Will still attempt to return somehow.  Don't even bother.
This mic gives off as much lint as my dryer.  Don't bother... spend the money on something better.  I'm a wedding videographer and these things just don't cut it with their plastic exteriors.
Of course, I should have followed my own advice when picking up a couple of this series issued about seven years ago by St. Clair Entertainment Group, Inc. Despite what it says on some of the headers here in Amazon, these are NOT the original recordings. In small print on the back its says "This album contains new stereo recordings performed by the featured artists" and, if you read some of the other reviews for the various entries, the sound quality, not to mention the voices themselves (which, in many instances, were getting a little long in the tooth when they did them) range from horrible to mediocre to barely adequate.Also there are no liner notes nor even a discography of the contents to at least tell you WHEN they were recorded. They are, however, cheap, and if you don't mind re-makes of what were some smash Country hits by some of the best artists ever, then by all means get them.As far as I can determine, the series covered, in addition to Barbara Mandrell: Freddy Fender; Charlie Rich; Waylon Jennings; Buck Owens; Porter Wagoner; Kitty Wells; Lynn Anderson; Willie Nelson; Donna Fargo; Kenny Rogers; Ray Price; Jeannie C. Riley; Lee Greenwood; Roger Miller; Faron Young; David Houston; Johnny Paycheck; and Merle Haggard.
To describe this as a Barbara Mandrell album is a distortion of the truth. Note the small lettering - and friends. What this means is that most of these songs were not recorded by Barbara. Even if one or two did feature her voice, they were very early recordings and do not even sound like her earliest recognized recordings - those she did for Columbia.I love Barbara's music - she is one of my all-time favorites - but you won't find any of Barbara's music here.
This program is ok, but it doesn't have enough samples as much as eJay. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND that you take one of the EJAY CDs(techno, rave, dance, hip-hop, etc) or take EJAY SE.ThanksDanny Dyer
There was no explanation what a SD CD was.  Be careful if ordering from this seller.  No one can listen to the CD without a specific SD CD player which isn't even sold anywhere.  Seller also asked me to pull my bad feedback and offered me a gift certificate if I gave good feedback.  Very tacky!
Woo, yamaha really did get carried away this time... I thought they could stick with something practical, but er.. this isn't it. I tried it in a store, and you can't even really mix with it, much less actually use it in a club or at a rave. If you wanna be a DJ and scratch, use turntables. If you are bent on scratching with a cd player then get the cd scratch mixer from American DJ, because it's a good bit better than this abomination.
I'm looking for a karaoke that plays cd's with graphics and also plays cassette tapes WITH GRAPHICS. Does the mks5001 do this or do you have any machine that does.Thanks,Myrna
My son was playing with these and within a hour it had cracked and there were lots of tiny metal balls all over the room. The other one broke within a couple of days!!
Ah yes emo, the soundtrack to rich white kids in the suburbs who listen to this junk because the new brat pack on the O.C. does. Well personally I hate emo, seriously, like there are very few forms of music I can simply not tolerate, country-rap-pop"punk-emo, that's it. I just can't stand those genres at all they piss me off.To emo listeners: wake up, shut up, and buy a god damn dead kennedy's cd or some other band but leave this emo garbage behind.
Imagine orchestrating a score to reflect the nervousness and agitation felt in a doctor's waiting room.The Finnish Euphonium fits just such a bill.The tuneless fiddling and toodling,and the hiccuping oboe would make anyone restless.Rx: Take this CD with two aspirin, then toss it... in the morning.
...This is a horrible album; the only thing I'm impressed with is how many cliches he's managed to fit in one cd.  I listened to it a second time, thinking it might be me, but no luck, this is one bad cd. The mix is way too rough, the guitar is too amatuerish.
...then don't try to use it. I've been waiting a month for any response from thier technical support. The documentation is hysterically bad. There are sections describing how to use one's mouse and what &quot;selecting&quot; means, and the rest of it is diabolically confused. There's never any indication of where functions being discussed are found, how to interpret the constantly shifting barrage of hybrid computer hardware/technical recording industry/made-up control name terminology, or... really, anything. It's useless. Several of the keyboard commands don't work, the icons are impossible to interpret, and there's no way to guess what parts of the intricate interface are active and which are merely display. If you have weeks and weeks of time on end, as I do at the moment, to play with it, and are masochistic, like me, then by all means purchase this product.
Installs incorrectly, requires helping program find files it can't locate without active intervention.  Poor interface system; user has to come all the way out of the program instead of going to main menu.  No booklet or other documentation.  I haven't been able to wade through it all, but the instruction program itself seems poorly laid out.  Avoid.
I tried this out thinking that it would at least let me do some sort of driving to learn what its suppost to teach, but no, it's only videos.  I watched 1 video, I dont even think the whole thing, and I looked around the whole thing and that was all there was.  I took it out and never tried it again, and that was more exciting than this.  This is pretty much just basic stuff.
I was very disappointed with this recording of The Bells. I sang this work a few years ago and wanted a recording to study with, only to find that it was very different from what Rachmaninoff had originally written. The words are arranged differently in several places, and even omitted altogether in others (very noticeably in the third movement). Otherwise, the sound quality is okay, the soloists are very nice. I recommend the recording by Riccardo Muti with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
The program only supports a few drives. Later Plextors made in the last year are not supported. HP drives are the only later model drives that are supported.  Because of this, I could not produce any CDs unless I exported the WAV files to another program to do the actual burning. The program was also very poor at determining where to set the track markers for the songs. Had to move many of the markers to the correct location. Program has lots of bells and whistles but it does not handle the basics well.
I should have listened to some of the bad reviews. One review said that they spend about 5 minutes per songs. I think it's more like 4. They don't "Teach" you anything. They just show you how Jimi played the song. Thats great and all but I'm not Jimi Hendrix. I would like to learn how to play like him, but the DVD does not teach. It actually gets annoying after a while because Velvert Turner, just keeps saying. Jimi then does this, Jimi then does that. Like I said before I'm not Jimi. The guitarist that plays the guitar to show you what Velvert Turner is talking about, just plays. I have to constantly play the DVD in slow motion but then I can't hear the sound. I hate this product. I also bought the book because the book has the TAB's and sheet music for the songs. The Book is excellent. I wish I had never bought the DVD, I spent $50 and I can't return it. BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bought this DVD to accompany the tab book I already have. Whereas tabs are note for note, this DVD presents the BARE SKELETON of the songs. You won't play like Hendrix, you will play a dumbed down version that does not do Hendrix justice. I have the Electric LadyLand DVD and it is way more informative, illustrative, and you play LIKE HENDRIX-NOTE FOR NOTE! I returned this DVD, it's too much money, and the lessons often are shorter than the song they are supposed to "teach." It's horrible....
Sound quality is just awful....very disappointed! A big waste of money!! Sounds like it was recorded on a cassette in someones garage!!
I own it.  I listen to it.  I've used it in church settings but I cannot recommend it for the casual listener.Underproduced.  In great need of an objective ear when casting vocal talent and mixing music and vocals.  I wanted so much to like this project and I cannot find it within me to do so.Sorry Mr. Wakeman.  Please try again.  I want this to work.
At first, Majix Hip-Hop maker can seem above any dj program. But switch to an even less complex one, Hip Hop E-Jay for instance, and you will find Majix's program easily defeated. It is the lack of sounds and videos to chose from that leads to the major bore. If you see this program on sale for $10 or less, go for it. If not, don't waste your money.
I think that Techno is a good music.  I like the product.  When I listen to the sounds and put them all together, they sound neat. You should buy it.  Games I recommend:  Worms 6, Delux Baseball 2, Hockey 4.0 for Mack, and the first demo disk on Playstation ever.  Buy them.
I've found MP3 Editor to be completely useless. You cannot make a CD from your MP3 files with it and the editing is too limited. I can't even adjust the volume of the whole song easily. Plus, I bought it because it had a rebate which now [I'm being denied] by saying that my receipt was dated outside of the offer, making this software a double ripoff.
BE WARNED! If you think this is a video recording of an orchestral performance, you will be sorely disappointed, as I was. It is merely a SOUNDTRACK of Debussy with pretty travelogue visuals glued on. There are NO VISUALS OF THE ORCHESTRA AT ALL, no shots of musicianly craftsmanship, faces concentrating, skilled fingers plucking, lips on the oboe, etc. -- nothing of that. It is merely a travelogue plus audio CD. You may as well play the CD in your car, while driving through your own visuals. For me this Naxos purchase was a total waste.
Does not work - I need to return it.  Not sure what is wrong with it but does not work.
This plus pack does not give you your moneys worth.  The fish screen saver only gives you 3 fish.  If you want more you can pay (dollar amount) to upgrade it and have more fish.  The bowling game is only 2 levels.  Then you can pay to get more.  For the price of this software these things should have been included.  There are only 4 themes total.  Aquarium, Da Vinci, Nature and Space.  The same themes from Win98 and ME!  Nothing new!
When I read &quot;Display your photos in new ways&quot;, I thought this might be what I want -- to display my photos in a 3D environment setting, and I bought this product from a retail store.But I was very disappointed with the limited function provided in the product. It provides only 6 very basic types of arrangement, not even as impressive as some free software. Recently, however, I bought a new software product called 3D-Album, which has much richer 3D presentations, and for 25 bucks, you got over 20 fantastic models, and you can even download new models posted daily from their website, for free!I like the XP Plus Aquarium. But it has only three fishes. To get more fishes, I have to pay more. If Microsoft could offer free downloads of new fishes like how 3D-Album does in their website, I wouldn't want to return this product!
WARNING: This product is terrible. Support is worse!I bought Windows XP yesterday. It will not load on my system, which is more than adequate to the task. It bails out of install with an error code of 3e6h, and nothing on the Microsoft website tells you what this is about.In addition, the upgrade version I am trying to install has hosed up my Millenium Edition and now I have a whole wonderland of problems.I just spent 45 minutes on HOLD, after finally getting through their front group and being referred to a technician. 45 minutes, and on your own dime yet! And why? Because XP is so fraught with failings that they are swamped with calls!AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!In a day when we now are beset with worries about anthrax, this is like the electronic version delivered in a box to cause more grief than it is worth.I have been working with computers for years, have upgraded many times, and never had troubles like this.My fond hope is that I can score a refund on money poorly spent on a product that lacks support or value to the average consumer.I only gave this product one star, because there was no option for none at all!
Plus is pretty cool, but you don't get much for your money. You get games that are just playable demos that if you want more levels you have to purchase them. (at outrageous prices) You get like 4 themes. They are pretty neat, but 4? How about a few more? You get a cool Aquarium screen saver that is lifelike with cool graphics. But, you only get 4 fish. To get more fish you have to buy them (for like half the price of Plus) from Microsoft. XP is a good OS, so far I haven't had any problems, but Plus isn't half the upgrade Plus for Win95 was. Don't bother getting it. It is too expensive and there isn't much to it.
I don't get this, in Plus 98 you get a whole bunch of themes and other stuff - in Plus XP you get nothing - well you get a couple of thems!  I cannot believe I paid for this - I uninstalled this and returned it for store credit - this is not worth $19.99 or $12.99 it is worth $1.99 - if you want some more themes for Windows XP look around on the internet for FREE ones and save your money!
I just jumped on line to purchase more strands of garland through Targets website and I was immediately drawn to the reviews. This product contains lead and should not be used around small children.  Needless to say, I will be returning my strand currently hung on my banister to Target immediately !!!!
I'm always in search of &quot;good&quot; recordings of opera seria.  I have a special interest in composers who have fallen between the cracks of music history and have discovered many gems in my search....Piccini included.  This might have been another, BUT...this performance is a severe disappointment, if not purely for the poor recording quality.  The orchestra is very lack luster and the singing performances are stilted and generic. Do yourself a favor...Miss this one!
UPDATE: Use iTunes instead for ripping CDs to the hard drive. As for audio editing, go pro or download Audacity.OLD REVIEW: Stay A-WAY from this!!Take it from me, a person that's had to put up with this for the last year, you will be sorry if you buy this unstable POS. Pardon my French. Well, now that I have XP and I've updated it with the latest updates from Windows Update, so I have the latest XP, here is what I've experienced:1.) Long launch times. When you click or double click on the AudioStation icon to open/launch it it sits there for about 5-7 minutes with the busy cursor spinning. You can't do anything with it until it wakes up.2.)Installing it was an adventure. A bad one. It will crash on you just before the end of the installation process. I found that you have to install the rest or repair it by using the Add or Remove Programs control panel under the Change or Remove Programs pane.3.) Don't let the "upgrade" from the Voyetra website fool you. It's even more unstable than the previous version. Crashing when you attempt to copy some MP3s off a CD. And this version's hang time is even longer.Until I can find a better MP3/CD-DA player/ripper/burner, I'll have to use the 5.0 version for copying MP3s at a reasonable bit rate. Windows Media Player doesn't even let you rip MP3s unless you buy a seperate MP3 codec. Whatever! So iTunes (which is free) can rip MP3s out of the installer (analogous to out-of-the-box) on a Mac, yet Windows Media Player requires you to buy that feature? Why?Just stay away from this software. Stay away. You'll be sorry you bought it. I sure am.
I tried this on multiple devices (even those listed on Sony web site) and in every case the audio was worse. Especially with the Kodak zi8.This device does not work. Do not waste your money.If a additional add-on microphone is not powered it will not work.
Meanwhile underneath the streets of Paris, the high command of SPECTRE is meeting (Sinister Period-Practice Enacted to Counter Traditional Readings Everlastingly). Chairing the meeting is Ernst Hogwood-Blofeld, the head of the nefarious organisation. On his lap sits the infamous Mister Bigglesworth, the moggy with attitude."We will now hear from the regional chiefs, starting with Number 2.""In the twilight of my career," the man croaked, "I enlisted with SPECTRE. There are more Mozart concertos coming to marketMozart: Sinfonia Concertante & Concerto for FluteandHorn Concertos Nos 1-4with some symphonies in trainMozart: Symphonies Nos. 39 & 40. They are virtually unlistenable and they're boring to boot.""Well done Number 2. In my earlier days when I was working my way up the ranks in SPECTRE, I recorded them too. Your versions are far more lifeless. We will now turn our attention to the Berlin station and Number 3."A luminary with a man perm and a smirk piped up nervously."We've been quiet recently Number 1, as EMI has finally worked out they're losing money on us - hence the switch to the Berlin Philharmonic's Digital Concert Hall. The survey of Symphonies 88 - 92 set Haydn's cause back ten yearsHaydn: Symphonies Nos. 88-92; Sinfonia Concertante. I do not want to rest on my laurels here at SPECTRE but they continue to irradiate the composer in the minds of the public. Better still, at my behest Number 7 Trevor Pinnock and Number 13 Ton Koopman recently conducted the Berlin Philharmonic. In the old days under the successive 007s, such fixtures would never have occurred."Number 2 winced at this point."Well done, Number 3. Even Mister Bigglesworth gets narky whenever I play your Haydn in the Bentley. We will now turn our attention to the Head of the Warsaw Station, Number 58."A youngish gentleman cleared his throat."So Number 1, you have finally heard my performances of K 491 and K 467. What do you think?"Hogwood-Blofeld pursed his lips."Number 58, I congratulate you for your clipped phrasing. It leaches so much of the vitality from the works. It is the hallmark of SPECTRE. I also thoroughly appreciated the use of a solo violin in the first movement of K 491 when our enemies, following the score, use the full deck. Indeed, I had never heard it before. It was a triumph of miniaturisation."Number 1 placed his hand on a level."Our expectations, however, were considerably higher. SPECTRE is a fraternity whose strength lies in the integrity of its members."Mister Bigglesworth hissed at Number 58."You played the entire first movement of K 491 at super pianissimo." The head of SPECTRE rumbled. "Not only is that hyper-romantic, it is also affected. We too have standards at SPECTRE. Romanticism also rears its ugly head in the slow movement of K 467. If you cannot decide whether you are for us or against us, it is time for you to go."Number 1 threw the lever forward and the hapless Number 58 disappeared in a blaze of fire."We will now discuss the Norrington Project in Stuttgart."
This is not an original artist album.  If you do not mind that its not original artist then it is fine.....I do not recommend it.
I picked up this disc for the Don Fardon version of Indian Reservation. I was very disappointed to find that this was a re-recorded version as are all of the rest of the tracks on this album. Forget this one!
ok, i wrote a review about this product a while back on this same page saying how good it was. I take EVERYTHING i said back. This is bound to be the worst buy I have ever made. I have had this product only 4 months, and three of the pads are broken. 2 will only make a very slight noise when you beat at it as hard as you can, and the other one is completely dead, and i do not believe i hit this drum set any more than anyone else. This machine has great sounds, but it has the worst durability ever. Do not buy this machine, I swear you will regret it, it may be good for little kids wanting to learn to play the drums but for any other use besides that, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
We didn't receive and directions or hardware with this keyboard stand,therefore it was just a wast of money.
I thought I'd be luckier than most of the previous reviewers, but no; when my Deluxe Keyboard Stand was delivered, it was missing eight screws and eight grippers, thus making it impossible to assemble.  I had to repack it and return it to Amazon.  What a waste of time.  I also noticed that it is designed so that, when seated, your knees hit the stand legs, making it almost impossible to use (should you ever get all the parts).I have since bought a very strong, properly-designed stand by Kaman in a local store (already assembled).  I suggest Amazon stop selling this Casio stand, as all the necessary parts often are not included.Kona
Looked be be what I was looking for but is not compatible with Windows 7. I will look for a newer version.
Sorry for such harsh remarks. I do not wish anyone to go to hell, but sheer anger I have for this daily recordist.Here is why: This is not Sir colin Davis we have known for making superb recordings with BSO or Concertgebouw in mid-60's through mid-80s. What was he on when he recorded the most sublime of musics in Catholic musics of all times? Neither I feel that LSO should be let go easily. Crapy orchestra, crappiest venue (The Barbican Hall). final wrath on the recording engineer/producers of esteem - Tony Faulkner and James Mallinson.Nothing in the work is mentioning worthy, but highest loath. LSO - You have cheated a lot of people with this CD and I for at least will boycott all your recordings that are made on LSO label! Hope that befits my anger I have towards this recording.Here is my suggestion: Go to local library and listen, before you buy this CD (or for that matter any LSO label).
Regardless of the merits of the performance, there is no libretto included. I was able to find it all on the net, in french, without translation. I read french, so that's not a hardship, but having 70 pages of printout to deal with when I wantto listen to 2 CDs is a problem. I wouldn't have bought it had I known. And this is EMI!!! Even Erato includes a libretto. [...]That being said, Gretry is BRILLIANT. The songs are catchy, beautiful, tender, memorable. The performance is crisp and convincing. A beautiful experience, and one that has set me to buying up the rest of Gretry's operas.
The power supply does not power the casio keyboard it is described to work with - period. I use batteries and do not know how to return the power supply item sent me...  DONT BUY IT - it does not work!!
Paid $80 for this program and have never been able to get it running.  Continuous errors on startup, despite the fact that I am trying to run it on a quality Windows XP Pro, IBM A31P machine.  Basically, just give your $80 to the nice kid working at the cash register, and skip the purchase -- your money will be better spent.By the way, tried to download patches to update my software, but oddly enough, the Magix website is &quot;down&quot;
Being a Resident of Sacramento you hear a lot of punk music and there are dozens of local punk bands on the scene.  But the Whiskey Rebels by far are the most overated band I have ever come into.  I came to show with an open mind but when I got there I was sickened.  They are a rancid ripofff, and a group of aging hipsters.  Thier music leaves much to be desired.  The cord progressions they use are very basic and the vocalist is obscenely bad.  I have never heard such simple music in my entire life.  The bass lines are perhaps the most sophmoric I have heard in a long time.  This band deserves no critical acclaim and the album is a waste of [money].
Hello all,I would be wary about buying a Yamaha DGX-500 from a third party seller from Amazon.I bought my DGX-500 last summer for about $400.  It seemed like a good deal b/c comparable models were at least $200 more.  There's a reason that Yamaha no longer offers the DGX-500 and the only ones you can find are refurbished.  The keyboard worked fine for 2 months, and I was very happy with it.  But one day I turned it on but the keys no longer played any notes.  I could turn on the keyboard, I could see the display was working, I could hear music whenever I pushed the demo button, but when I try to press a key nothing happens.  I believe there's a connection problem between the keys and the actual keyboard.Amazon was no help after a month, because I bought the keyboard from a third-party vendor, and they do not take responsibility for their third party vendors.  I called Yamaha and they tried to help me out, but they were of no help.  I could not reset the keyboard because the keys did not work (If you push the highest key while turning on the keyboard, it's suppose to reset the keyboard and give you a message, but I got no message).  Yamaha's warranty was not applicable because the vendor was not an authorized Yamaha dealer.In retrospect, I wish I had bought the keyboard from a local shop.  I would have gladly payed an extra $200 not to have to deal with this hassle.
Hardly picks up the sound through the MIC input port on the laptop.Tried 2 laptops, this mic simply sucks
needed a microphone. this sucks. the sound quality is terrible if u connect to ur laptop, u wont be able to record anything bc it sounds so low and poor. only the left side got recorded and was audible. complete garbage.
It didn't even work! They make it look nice and everything but what you get is what u pay for. Don't buy one of these ever!
Got two of these a year ago.lets say from the start,Don't waste your money! buy something else.never could get a decent signal thru them and when they "worked" 1/2 of it was noise and intermittent cut outs.after about two months of light use..tossed them in the trash.
Value does not always mean buying the cheapest item in the market. When it comes to cables sometimes their purpose in the whole scheme of things is often over looked. To me buying one set of Monster Cables, that will last a life time, and produce a true sound with zero interfence. That's more of a value to me, than buying these every year or few months, and having sub par sound. I have given Fender Cables a true chance three times and they have let me down everytime. These and the Cali's are made in China. And, I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. They are a complete waste of money.
Don't sell things u don't understand. Let us know if u figure out what an ADAT sync and/or guitar cable is.
Jiggle around the jack and you might be able to get it to work every now and then. Don't waste your time/money.
I'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing. They're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. Drop few more bucks and get something else!
the 1/4 jack plug is a bit narrow.I purchased two of these to connect my studio monitors to my mixer.. I have a large range of 1/4 cables and have never had a problem but the diameter of the 1/4 plug on these cables is simply to small.... they are not a tight fit into the socket and the sound can cut in/out.of course..i had already thrown away the packaging...........sigh
I bought this cable because I wanted a shorter version of the cables I normally use.  It looks good, but did not work.  I had other cables to compare with my mic, so I know 100% it was a defective cable.  Bummer.
It just doesn't work. The package was opened when I got it and it had a loud humming noise when plugged into both my amp and computer. I didn't even bother returning it. What a waste of money.
I've never had so much noise in a cable before! My intention was to run a shotgun mic into my DSLR. I've used the shotgun mic for many years on many other cameras with no noise problems, but when I used this cable, all I got was static and barely any of the actual signal. To make sure it wasn't my camera I tested this cable out with a number of different mics, cameras and even my computer. The cable was the problem. Maybe it was just a faulty cable, but I wouldn't want to risk it failing in the middle of a shoot.
DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU LIKE QUALITY OF SOUND. IT WILL CAUSE AMPLIFIERS TO HISS AT BEST BUT MOST WILL JUST TRANSFER SOUND PROPERLY
Ok so these Cables are good if your in a rush and have a gig and forgot some cables at home. however these things don't last at all. belive me when I say it does not pay to be cheep. If you go with something a bit more Pricey it will be worth it in the long hall.. expectly if you are gigging alot or on tour
What a complete waste of money!  I'm a big fan of Peter Cook but this is best avoided.  A collection of poor quality recordings of random conversations that are so hard to follow that it is not even of minimal biographical interest, let alone being entertaining in any way - forget it!
I worshiped Peter Cook.  "Beyond The Fringe" changed my life.  I followed those four men through their various and distinctive careers.  I think I have all of their recorded works.  Peter's last decades were not happy.  These CDs are terribly sad.  Peter moved next door to a man named George Weiss, who shared Peter's love of drugs and alcohol, but not his wit.  But George thought himself the equal of Moore, Bennett, and Miller, and began taping their late-night ramblings.  By this time Peter, the razor-thin, razor sharp wit was the size of Jabba the Hutt and about as coherent.  One 25-minute cut documents the two of them heating up baked beans.  Some crank phone calls to a radio station are the funniest things on this album, but they're not very inventive.  When Peter got drunk with Dudley for "Derek & Clive" it was pretty funny.  But more of the same, "Derek & Clive: Come Again" was terrible.  If you value the wonderful work that Peter Cook left as his legacy, steer clear of this and buy the wonderful book, "Tragically I Was An Only Twin", the scripts of everything he wrote.  He died sad and bitter, but you don't have to share that.
I was hoping this would have more of a piano feel to it. This pedal requires a lot of pressure to get any sustain out of my casio keyboard. If I have shoes on and "stand" on the pedal, it will sustain the notes I play. It is far from the lighter touch I am used to on a real piano. On a real piano, I can let my heel rest on the floor and with light pressure on the pedal it will depress fully. It would be nice if they made the tension adjustable. Also, it is just an on-off switch. In other words, the degree of sustain does not vary (as it does with a piano), making it even more unrealistic. I would recommend shopping around if you want a piano-like pedal, or if you want a pedal that does not require a lot of pressure to work.
I had asked the salesman at the Best Buys what software would let me record LP's and cassette tapes into my computer for playback and burning to CD's. He sold me this Music Creator 2003 and when I tried to use it it turned out to be a complete waste of my thirty bucks! I kept getting asked to specify a MIDI output and found out it wouldnt accept the one on my VAIO with XP. I was also rudely informed I would have to buy yet another software from 12Tones to get closer to my purpose of buying this in the first place.I am forced to rate it as one star when it actualy earns a minus one.If you want to record your LP's and cassettes into your computer and play them on it or put them on a CD, FORGET this &quot;stuff&quot;!Buy a stand-alone CD recorder!
This mixer is definitely garbage but if you buy the Stanton Spin Cycle Pak, it's adequate for beatmixing and blending. Don't even try to scratch using this though. The crossfader on mine started crackling and bleeding after about 2 weeks. Def. not recommended
Order placed Jan16.No explanation received for late delivery.Dont mind waiting,but should be told why.Hope this item comes with a stand.....its the least casio should do.
Bad background noise - tried everything to reduce with no luck. Returned.
Previous reviews did not do the correct justice to the item sold.Ordered this item back in November, the delivery was delayed, missing mic was not in the box. Amazon sent a second set to me, the lavalier mic was still missing in the second set, by the time money was refunded and missing mic bought, it was end Jan. Terrible experience.DO NOT BUY THIS SET AS THE ESSENTIAL LAVALIER MIC WILL BE MISSING FROM THE BOX.
Amazon has to watch out their partners. There are many trying to fish in rough waters. How is it possible that this item is fluctuating from $60 to beyond $100 when the listed suggested price in Sony's page is $75?Please Amazon: In order to improve your services which are already very good, you need to tie down these opportunists and not let them to ask for prices beyond listed.
spend a little more money and get a better mic! this one doesn't do what its supposed to do! shop around
Either I got a lemon, or I am the most soft-spoken person on the planet. When I record in GarageBand, even turning the volume up to Max on all settings doesn't help enough. Recording in iMovie HD is nearly inaudible. Recording in iMovie '08 can be made to work if you Normalize the Clip Volume after the fact, but even so, the audio only shows up on the left channel.I guess I'll have to save my money and buy something six times as expensive if I want something that works.
Audible hum obscures subject's voice.  Studio tech attributes to poor cable sheathing or ground fault -- either way, device simply not usable for good quality video projects.  Disappointing offering from good company.
I bought this microphone to use with Skype and a set of Bose headphones.  It produces only very faint sound with my Dell Latitude D630 laptop, even with the sensitivity on the sound card up all the way. It could be the battery, but it was the new battery in the package and these generally have a pretty long shelf life. Some other reviews also mention the faint sound. I just did not see them before purchasing the unit.
Two main comments:First - the package came ripped and taped together - it was obviously used and was missing 2 cables and the instructions. Unfortunately I didn't open it before the return window was over or I would have returned it.Second - it's awful. The sound recorded is soooo quite and there's no way to turn it up. Plus, I need a wireless mic to film yoga videos. The feedback on this thing is horrible. I test it, test it again, test a third time and it seems ok, then I film and there's static and high-pitched whining noises and I have to scrap hours worth of video. I tried troubleshooting it per the instructions on Audio Technica's website, but nothing helps.Maybe I just got sold a returned lemon. Either way DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! It's not worth the hassle. I'm now going to have to buy a super expensive one and hope that it works, though I'm not hopeful after this experience. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know.
I tried first and the interference was minimal... but when I did my recording session all the sound was full of static... the quality was so bad that I couldn't use the audio... I was really frustrated... I don't even understand how come some people gave it a good review... I know it's a low priced product but when I say I can't use any of the recorded sound i'm not exaggerating
If you are 2 feet away from your subject and there are no obstacles such as air between both of you, then this might be the mic for you. Lots of static and absolutely unreliable. If you are a serious video pro, avoid this system.
I have 4 other cartridges (1 Numark and 3 Audio-Technica) and 2 turntables (1 Technics and 1 Numark).This cartridge has 2 big problems- Low output level and high susceptibility to hum.The first problem would be forgivable- a low output level can just be cranked up- if it weren't for the other problem.None of my other cartridges on either of my turntables produces _any_ audible hum.This cartridge has it so strong that it is unusable for normal listening, much less archiving.Probably if there was no AC field nearby, it would be fine, and there is a television within 4 feet of the turntables.However, the bare fact is that none of the other cartridges are picking up the hum - only this one is problematic.It is the lowest output and by FAR highest AC-hum-pickup cartridge I've ever used...Note, the frequency response and construction are all pretty good - I just wish it didn't have the major flaws...
This stylus gauge is made of plated steel which is magnetic.  It is attracted to the cartridge magnet and therefore useless.  I returned it immediately.I am surprised that Shure would manufacture something that has such an obvious flaw which defeats the very purpose of the device. Unfortunately, the only alternatives are much more expensive digital stylus gauges.
DO NOT BUY!  Look carefully - Shure A12 is a microphone stand mounting flange, NOT A V15 Cartridge as FALSELY displayed & reviewed!  As did I, you will end up paying a high price for a piece of metal usually sold for approx. $8.55.  I believe that the normally ultra reliable Amazon .com has also been misled in presenting this sham.
A waste of [...] bucks! A non-condensor mic performs better than this thing. On the good side, it looks pretty with the wind shield on it.
On the long distance setting it only works if your not more that 2 inches away. Don't waste your money!!!!!
I purchased this shotgun mic for my Kodak Zi8 camera because I had seen it successfully used on YouTube.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get the device to work properly.  When in the tele mode, it recorded at very low levels even with a new battery and with the volume input turned up on the Zi8.  The normal mode didn't seem to work at all.  Vendor took a return with no questions asked and I now use a lavaliere type mic.
These are the worst headphones ever! I bought them at radio shack for $52 and they are going back first thig tomorrow.
I purchased this recording about a year ago, but only tried to play it on my laptop the other day.  I was shocked to find that by doing this, I had allowed Sony to install their infamous Rootkit DRM on my hard drive.  For those few who are unaware of this problem, Sony put a little program called a rootkit into their DRM program just about when this cd was published.  This digital rights management software contains a file that hides from being detected,  and sends information to a remote computer about your listening habits (and God knows what else).  Because it conceals itself, many antispyware and antivirus programs don't detect it.  It then can enable trojans and viruses to penetrate the hard drive and wreak HAVOC.Anyone unfamiliar with this problem need only google "SONY DRM ROOTKIT"  to find out how destructive this little program is.While the music is lovely, anyone considering the purchase of this cd should refrain unless they can be sure that they have a copy that does not have the SONY DRM on it, or refrain from trying to put it on your digital player or listen on your computer.  I've emailed Zigzag-Territoires about this, but have yet to hear a word from them.  By now, they have had ample time to reply.Save yourself the heartburn.  No recording is worth the trouble of getting a rootkit cleaned from your hard drive.  Avoid this cd.
Unfortunately I am unable to review this product since what I received was the Yamaha PA-150, a product I didn't order! I am living overseas so it was important to have the PA-5D adapter, which would work with the voltage here.  Now I need to connect to a transformer first, bother.  As I ordered this for a group of African musicians and not myself it would have really been nice to have the PA-5D.That said, the PA-150 does function with the Yamaha PSR 225 keyboard that it is being used with so that is good.  I just hope someone doesn't come along and plug it into a 220v socket and burn it up.
hey i buy my cables from amazon/monopricebut not xlr cablesburned too many timesthis thing has no warrantymine stopped working in a month, loose connectionsstick to monster, their xlr cables are on sale in guitar center:(
Despite the claim that both units take AA batteries, the unit we recieved takes 9V Batteries.  That is somewhat annoying because one of the reasons we bought this model was because of the AA battery usage as advertised.  Will review performance when we've had a chance to use it.
Used this lavalier mic system for a recent short film that I did and the sound quality was absolutely terrible... A whole half of the audio obtained from day one shootings went down the crapper... The sound was muffled and had a ridiculous amount of hiss in the background especially when my actors spoke... This is one area where if you want quality sound you cant be cheap... I would not recommend these to anybody looking to take serious audio...
I really dont know that I can make feedback here , my friend just told me that i can do it . but seriously it is so bad alot of noise and too much noise you cant even hear what the speaker says. I really don recomment any one to buy it. save your money and buy good one and dont wast your money on somthin like this product, I really feel so sorry I wish if i can return it  back, I still have everything on it. plz I need my money back plz .thanks
This isn't a bad video but I opted for the "buy it with this" Amazon and didn't realize it was a compilation of the other video I had just bought. The other two into one video is  more informative and comes with tab. Do youself a favor and buy the video that has both original videos on it.
The included plastic straw is too small to fit on the nozzle making it impossible to apply the spray with precision.
I got this CD uesd They said it was like new, But sounded like an old 78. No I will not buy from this outfit again
How is it possible that nice music so bad is recorded on this CD.It seems that the technical controle has failed.I'm sorry to write this but SOUNDS OF YESTER YEAR is in my case for the second time an awful product.It's for the first time that I have to give such a negative comment.Probable disappointment on both sides.simon van der schoot
This is not Dave Matthews, this is DAVID Matthews, big band artist, apparently from Japan.  Amazon is wrong in confusing these musicians.
My beef is not with Amazon's shipper, which was fine. The CD itself -- in particular, the Koppel recording -- is by a group that seems to have played a few extra measures and otherwise plays with little rhythmic consistency.
Nowhere on the box, website, or anywhere, is it mentioned that you MUST keep the CD in the drive at all times. I planned to use my netbook with a Yamaha CLP-170 (it fits right on top when you fold the sheet-music holder down). Trying to transfer the CD to a USB-drive for installation won't work - ultimately it checks for the CD. Now I am stuck. While I completely agree that once you open software it shouldn't be returnable, not only can I NOT use it, but what's it to Adventus to return my money? After all, I couldn't have copied it. I tried their 'Live Chat', but they pretended not to understand my question and disconnected me! Is my English improper or confusing to you? I didn't think so.This is not an Amazon issue. Adventus should clearly state that this is a requirement that could stymie your installation.
I bought this software, because the company does not exist anymore, so I wanted to add my karaoke songs to this one. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box is that it stinks, literally. The whole content stinks like it was use as an ashtray. The second thing is that it does not play my other karaoke that I bought from the website. Good thing it was cheap.
After listening about 5 times to the new album of BNH I still can't cover my frustration. After 7 years of silence everyone expected some changes in a band, but the way they moved in is very disappointing. This is not a coming-back album. The acoustic instruments, the jazzy vibes, the always exciting tunes are completely gone. What remains instead is undistinguished R'n'B music. It is simply BORING. Not a one star music, but still 4 stars weaker than previous BNH albums...
I bought one of these from a local retailer. Got it home, followed the install directions for the latest Mac OSX 10.6.2 drivers and fired up Audio Midi Setup panel. It showed the Midisport Uno just fine in the panel. However, when I connected it to both a 25 key controller and a Yamaha DTXpress II drum brain, nothing would happen. I downloaded midimonitor (freeware) and it was monitoring midi just fine as well as the LED's on the Uno would light. However, I could not get it to transfer midi to any of my programs (Garageband, EZdrummer, etc). After some research I saw where some kits were defective so I took it back and got a new one - same problem!! After even more research it appears there is a known issue with the Macbook and Macbook Pro unibody machines not playing nice with this specific Uno hardware. And yes I verified with M-audio that this was supposed to be the newest revision. Even their tech support finally emailed back and admitted the incompatibility (7 days later). I'm done with M-audio and their cheap CRAP! Edirol's a bit pricier but is a more trusted brand...
I've tried the EM-U and this M-Audio Uno (twice) and they've both failed over and over again. They work for a while (about a year or so) and then suddenly stop working. The warranty is only for a year so that makes it an expensive investment. Not recommended.
This is a horrible company. I would recommend staying far away from anything M-Audio makes.  They don't support their own hardware. They refuse to make 64 bit drivers for some of their devices (Radium49 for example). I would recommend getting a different brand because you can be guaranteed that this company will not provide updated drivers for any product you buy in the future.Buyer beware.
DO NOT RECOMMEND - HDOA (half dead on arrival).  Got this device, installed it, connected to my Casio WK-3000 keyboard.  MIDI output (to keyboard) worked great, input did not work.  Since I bought my Casio used, I thought it might be the keyboard.  Took me a while to round up another to try (out of town for a while) - but same thing when I did.  Bought a new (MUCH cheaper - $10) MIDI USB interface, had in working in two minutes.  Unfortunately my return window had expired :(DO NOT RECOMMEND - there are much cheaper alternatives, and they work!
It takes alot of nerve to continue to sell a product that will not work on the latest and widely accepted version of Windows. It's not like Win 7 just came out last month, and there should be enough similarity between 7 and Vista in terms of driver architecture that creating a driver for this should not have been a problem. M-Audio apparently does not want to invest in providing drivers for anything but their most expensive products, so if you have Win 7 or believe you may anytime in the foreseeable future, look for hardware from a company that will actually support its own products. FAIL.
After countless posts and tickets opened with M-audio technical support I went out and bought a Roland EM-2ex.  All the issues I was experiencing (random notes playing, device not recognized, etc) are a thing of the past.  The only thing that really bothers me is that I spent around $50, and could have returned the product for a refund if I hadn't spent time trying to get it to work (as the M-audio technician said it would).The last update to my technical case was the technician saying that this unit did in fact not work with my akai ewi, and I should instead go out and buy a 1x1.  The uno seems to work fine for some, but if you are one of the unlucky few, good luck getting any kind of support or firmware update.  I would recommend you avoid at all cost.
This never worked the way it should have.  I bought this many years ago for my mac, never worked.  Recently got a pc, same problems.The midi information sent to my computer is &#34;drunken&#34;, timing is way off, notes come in jumbled groups separated by gaps of nothing.  It seems the processing power is just not fast enough.
Acid Pro 4.0 has a lot of functionality and I have enjoyed using what little portions of it I can. However, I give the product 1 star because it does not come with an adequate user's manual. It has an extremely light weight 10 page "guide" that isn't worth the paper it's written on. There was a huge user manual published but Sony has discontinued it, and I can't seem to find one. If you've already used the program, you'll be ok. Otherwise, stick with Acid, the non-pro version. Having all the functionality and not being able to harness it stinks. :(
I listened to my Mel McDaniels tapes for years and wanted to upgrade to CD, But these sound nothing like the original songs.
I bought this because I wanted to stay away from all the m-audio external usb ones that everyone was complaining had driver problems.This audio card has "jumpers" on it just like the old hard drives. Microphones will not work unless you set them up properly! It's not just pug and play. It's a bit more complex of a set up.  The manual is very bad at walking you though about the jumper settings and a lot of people complain about the poor manual in the user forums on their official web site with a lot of unanswered important questions.This audio card has horrible driver problems!I tried the audio card on a few computers just to make sure it was not just 1 computer having problems with it. The card was tightly in the slot every time. I tested it with both the cd driver and the slightly newer down-loadable driver just to make sure. The audio card is unstable and will work one moment and not the next and a lot of audio programs find fault with this card giving you errors and glitches some times.You do not want to be working with a singer and the card just stops working and the computer stops detecting it for a second!Pro-Tools even gave some errors with it and this is meant to be used with pro-tools!I could not stand all the glitches it has with all the audio software I was testing it out with. No audio programs out of the 6 I used worked good with this and some did not work at all with it. I can't even say 1 good thing about this card.Save money and time and just buy a nice expensive usb mic and forget these audio cards and usb devices and if you need midi try another card.
Gyorgy Ligeti's "Piano Etudes", with two books completed and one in progress, are some of contemporary music's most outstanding works for piano. Ligeti began the work in the early 1980's as part of a wholesale evaluation of his compositional technique. Gone is the micropolyphony of his earlier pieces, but in its place Ligeti displays a number of ingenious new musical avenues, with two major inspirations. The first is chaos theory and fractal mathematics, and the second is African polyphony. What makes the Etudes particularly fascinating is that some of them are meant to be too fast for any human pianist, and their definitive versions are for player piano. For some of these player piano renditions one should seek out "Gyorgy Ligeti Edition 5: Mechanical Music". Ligeti's favourite merely human pianist is Pierre-Laurent Aimard, who gives a must-have performance of the first two books on "Gyorgy Ligeti Edition 3: Works for Piano".Unfortunately, on this disc Idil Biret gives a very poor performance. She decides to ignore the given tempo and play slowly by only by the musical markings. This is a silly decision, showing that she prepared this recording with little study of the material or forethought. Biret just ignores what Ligeti intended and plays painfully slowly. She also plays rather heavily, and doesn't have the nimbleness of other pianists who have tackled the work.This collection is unusual among human performances in that it contains Etude 14a, "Coloana fara sfarsit" which Ligeti premiered as a player piano performance on "Gyorgy Ligeti Edition 5: Mechanical Music". It is, in fact, the original fourteenth etude, but when even Aimard begged Ligeti for something a human could approach, Ligeti substituted "Coloana Infinita" instead. Biret should have known that this piece is simply too fast for a mere mortal, and her performance of it is incredibly ugly.The liner notes give a brief description of each piece of the Etudes, and Biret's own apology for her method of approaching it all. However, everything is rather spare, as is usual with a Naxos disc, and Romanian words are annoyingly typeset incorrectly.I would recommend getting the performance by Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Ligeti's favourite pianist, on "Gyorgy Ligeti Edition 3:  Works for Piano". That recording has the benefit of being supervised by Ligeti himself and so can be slightly definitive. While Biret's renditions here have the affordability of a Naxos disc, she gives a flawed performance that should be avoided.
All Roxio products I've used on several different operating systems have always had one problem or another. I found their support staff to be worthless and returned my last Roxio Product vowing to never buy anything they made again. I know others rave about Roxio but I think as with all products there is always a certain percentage of dedicated enthusiasts that will support the product regardless of problems. System lock-ups might be expected on slower cpu's with little memory but I've had some powerhouses freeze up with Roxio.
After re-installing Easy CD Creator 5.3.4, which was bundled with my new tower from Dell (it didn't work when I tried it - therefore the re-install), on reboot the computer crashed and I got the black screen of death. The XP recovery disc enabled me to get back up and running thanks to help from a friend.  I then tried to re-install, omitting Direct cd which I was told was the problem, and the install hung. After getting unhung I  went to the Roxio web site and downloaded a patch.  The patch did about as much good as hitting my computer with a shovel. My advice - if Roxio has stock, don't buy it. These guys can't possibly stay in business much longer. What a bomb!
First of all, the only reason this even gets one star is because Direct CD and the main disc burning utility work fairly reliably - but these apps are NOT why people usually go for the upgrade.  I find it hard to give a good rating based on basically the same applications as 5.0.  If you have 5.x and only use these apps mainly, do not watse your money on 6.0, or at least go with something like Nero.Now, if you are looking for software to author DVDs - which alot of people are (hence the change in name from Easy CD to Easy CD DVD) - DO NOT buy this product.  The DVD Builder is one of the most flawed applications, and crashes without fail at least 75% of the time.  It main problmes are 1) poor user interface (i.e. too few commands and customability); and most importantly 2) not being able to remain stable while importing various types of media.  I have found the DVD builder only really works well if you encode and set up the media files in some separate app, so basically the DVD builder has little to do - but if you are going through the trouble of doing all this, what is the point.To sum it up, I have tried every configuration - but DVD builder still remains unreliable and unstable - and yes, I have tried uninstalling Nero and related apps - and yes my comp has the processor and RAM power to push it; in other words, I'm certain this is the app, not my comp.  Go to Roxio's Web site and look at their message boards and forums; you'll see page after page of similar complaints. So, if you are only burning CDs, sure, this prgram is okay - but why spend extra money when you can get 5.0.  If you author DVDs, you'll be better off with pretty much any other program you can find.
This is probably the most user-unfriendly software I've ever bought when it comes to creating music CDs.  Everytime I needed to burn a music CD I had to go to the tutorial for the various steps.  Version 5 was great compared to 6. The only problems with 5 is that it can't be used with Windows XP and you have to download a patch to fix the problems with it.I had no problem like others with installing 6.  However some months after I did install it I started having problems with the "drag and drop" software.  This is software that can be used to "drag and drop" any file (music or non-music) to burn a CD.  It turned out to be a nightmare.  CDs were not able to be finalized.  When you install the drag and drop software it simply takes over for the CD burning method of Windows XP (which is far, far superior).  I uninstalled the software and simply did a custom install by just installing the photosuite (the only useful thing in Creator 6).
I wholeheartedly agree with every negative article related to this product - if you use windows XP.  As an example the Label maker does not refresh properly so the graphics bleed into one another.  Tech support almosts laughs at people with their standard comments - oh its going to be fixed on the next upgrade.  I'm not sure how they let this product out the door.  It's too bad becuase their earlier versions did its job relatively seemlessly.
If you own Easy Creator 5, I can't think of any good reason to purchase this product.  The only thing it does well is burn data and files to CD's, and EC-5 does that equally well.  The Photosuite section is one of the most exasperating pieces of software I've ever tried to use - and it deletes EC-5's ability to archive pictures along with a self-running exe player that provides both shortage and self-running slide show capabilities (with music) on one CD.  If you need a photo album and picture editor program, first look at what came with your digital camera, possibly augmented by one of the cheaper Adobe editing products, or purchase Jasc After Shot or it's latest incarnation.  If you need DVD/Video capture or editing software, buy Sonic's MYDVD Video Suite - It's significantly simpler and more flexible to use, and produces DVD's with better playing characteristics.  The Audio capture/playing/editing features seem only different, not better than EC-5, and maybe not as good.  The Drag-to Disk feature is back - but I've never found that feature to be worth the effort to use it, with any CD/DVD burning program.  And lastly, the basic operation of the program seems even more quirky than EC-5, and counter-intuitive to every other piece of software you likely own.  Bottom line, I installed it, tried it, deleted it, and reinstalled the elements of EC-5 I use.  Was a total waste of $...
I'm both relieved and bummed to find so many others have experienced the same catastrophe I did in installing this product.  It came bundled with a DVD burner from one of THE top names in the industry, and it shuffled my folders across my partitioned hard drive like a drunken poker player.  Windows even lost all sight of a 60gig external hard drive -- it would dutifully &quot;beep&quot; in hardware recognition when I unplugged and replugged the drive into its firewire port, but the drive itself might as well have been in the Phantom Zone.  Until Roxio makes clear -- In. No. Uncertain. Terms. -- that this issue has been fixed, I would not recommend the product to anyone but my boss at work.
It always smiled at me the it called me stupid I warn you never ever get this  I hope you wonder stand
Had basic 5 version, which gave me problems. Tried to upgrade, blew the hard drive. Norton said 1038 Registy errors.  Talked with computer shop, found that the errors &quot;not unusual&quot;.
Do not buy this if you are planning on using Windows Vista.  There are no (not even beta) drivers and the Windows XP/64 drivers do not work.  M-Audio seems totally arrogant about the whole thing and there are no target dates for any driver support (which hasn't even been confirmed).
Lights jump all over the place, has a hard time telling which string your  plucking. Definately not worth it! Might as well spend a little more money on something that will actually work.
I bpught this cd for the wondeful sonf, A Love Divine, which i heard sung in a  local catholic church by a  lone female voice + piano. Beautiful in words and music. She captured the essence of the song. So i thought I'd like to have this wonderful spiritual on cd at home.However this version is slightly different tempo than the one I heard at mass, but it goes further. Here the chorus director has so mellowed and slowed the song, to where it just oozes and cralws. This lifelss and boring  version is so far from  the way the young lady and her accompaning piano player has "divined" this song. Its spiritless chorus like this one that can surely keep more folks away from the churches that as a  means to draw the souls in.there's no other way to say it.
I just received the CD today but It does not working on my Bose system , i tried in my computer also
Be wary of buying this product.  It is very difficult to use and even the simplest things seem to be a problem.  When I use the software, the registration page seems to pop up even after I registered.  I also had problems getting technical support help.  There is no phone support, and the website and FAQ is severly lacking in any help.  Save your money!
I was very disappointed.  Because of the format (DVD) I expected hands-on how to instruction.  This was a man facing the camera reciting tips that could easily have been printed on a few pages.  There is no reason these "tips" should have been presented in a DVD format.  I feel tricked.
I do better using the built-in Windows multimedia applications and the 'Nero' burner and wave editing software that was bundled with my CD burner.  This was the MOST disappointing purchase I have ever made in my life.  Nothing on the box even HINTS at the license agreement restrictions, which requires you to upgrade to a 'pro' (or 'royalty free') product if you don't want to include something similar to 'Created via MAGIX' in anything you publish, even the FREE stuff (either that or violate the license agreement), regardless of whether or not you use any of the samples.  Further, I couldn't even load a simple MIDI file without the application CHANGING THE TEMPO and as well as all of the patch information in the process.  So after converting the MIDI file to '.wav' format (using the windows application 'sndrec32' and the media player, like I usually do) I then added this track as #1, and started trying to add extra tracks, only to find out that the ONE feature that would have made this valuable was missing:  NO 'per channel' graphic equalizers!  And the "tone control" (not even a graphic EQ) had only 3 levels for bass, mid and treble!  Even the free software that came with my CD Burner (namely, Nero Wave Editor) has a multi-band graphic EQ in it (and you can even change the frequencies for each band).  So much for "effects".  I was completely dissatisfied.  I immediately uninstalled it and looked on the box for "money back guarantee" so I could return it.  And you know what?  There's no money back guarantee. (...).
I just bought this program and boy, am I sorry!  There is so much wrong with this program it's hard to know where to begin.  First off, it crashes quite frequently.  The documentation is terrible.  The &quot;synthesizers&quot; are worthless, except for the beat box, which is pretty cool (but which crashed on me whenever I tried to play the RockPop default beat).  The guitar synthesizer is particular hopeless: there is a big echo and vibrato on the notes which is impossible to remove, and you have to include 64 bars (you can't just do, say, 8).  The bass synthesizer's notes are transposed up a whole tone for some reason, and you can only play one note at a time.  The samples are OK, but forget about it if you like rock music; there's next to nothing there.  There isn't even a good generic bass sample, just weird funky stuff.  There are tons of little interface glitches, annoyances, and misfeatures.  I could go on and on and on, but the bottom line is that this software exhibits incredibly shoddy workmanship.  If I were Magix, I would be deeply ashamed to have released something this bad.
I read some of these other reviews that stated that this mic was cheap and did not pick up sound very well. I should have paid attention, but it was cheap and it was from Sony so I figured how could I go wrong. Well the mic is a piece of junk and worthless to me. You have to cup your hand around the the end and with you mouth just a 1/2 inch from it's surface you have to shout for anything to be recorded at a near normal level. Perhaps this would be of some benefit for loud singing but for normal speaking level it is completely useless. It was cheap enough that I just wrote it off as the time and effort it would of taken to repackage and repost would not of been cost effective. Don't buy it. Spend a little more money and get something that works.
Don't buy this. There are deaf toddlers who can record my voice better than this microphone.
This never worked for me on an amp or my computer. Don't waste your money.
It's the old saying - you get what you pay for. I was suspicious with the cheap price and for good reason. Not only does this NOT work with my newest Sony HD Camcorder, it doesn't even work when trying to record while plugged directly to my laptop. (???) I'm not sure how Sony could continue to sell a product like this when it obviously does not work. I will not be buying another Sony mic regardless of the cost!
This microphone (if that's what you wanna call it) has to be the absolute worse product I have ever purchased in my entire life. You literally have to physically touch the music with your mouth with both hands cuffed around it and even then you still cant barely hear a thing even with volume on full blast. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. even if this item were a dollar I would say it isn't worth it!
Sony Omnidirectional Microphone is smaller than usual one, its sound is so little whenever and whatever I adjust it to. It makes  me so upset. It sucks. Don't buy it. Don't use it. It is made in china. I want to send it back to the seller for a refund or exchange of other kinds of microphone. Please help me solve it.
This microphone barely picks up sound. I worked and worked before I was able to convince myself it is picking anything up. I purchased singing machine smm205 which works fine and threw this one away. Also omnidirectional is not good for voice.
My in-laws purchased this machine for my daughter last Christmas. I read the directions, plugged it into an outlet, then went back to the owner's manual to continue reading. Within twenty seconds I smelled something awful, looked up, and saw SMOKE billowing out of the top of the machine! I could not believe my eyes--I have never had any electronics product do this before in my life. I immediately unplugged it and dashed it outside in case it caught on fire. What a total piece of JUNK! The unit was powered OFF, not even turned on for the first time! I am giving it one star because I cannot give it 0 or negative stars. This will be my last experience with any smoking Craig product!!
I wish Santa had checked this before giving it to my daughter Christmas morning.  The camera didn't work at all and there were no words ont the monitor.  Eventually a few fussy words appeared on part of the screen.  Fortunately I purchased the Buyer Protection Plan.  The plan works great (so far) but I will still be out the cost of the plan (&lt;$10.00) and alot of aggravation.  My neighbor got a different machine and the stop button didn't work.  Maybe the companies that make these machines have a high % of product defectiveness???  I got a different model (the orriginal has been discontinued) and it works fine, better if hooked up to a stero and TV.  This one doesn't have a camera.  I bought the buyer protection plan again - it's cheep and worth it since the warrenty is so short.
Many of the files are repeats, many more are corrupt.  Most importantly the quality is very poor, I would guess most (80%) are 11.025/8bit/mono.  Too low quality for anything over a school project.  I wouldn't even put them on my desktop.
This compilation may call itself 'Starship: Greatest Hits,' but this is Starship featuring Mickey Thomas, the newest incarnation of the group in which Mickey Thomas is the sole original member from its 1980s heyday. These are not very good re-recordings, and while Thomas still sounds very good for a man of his age (this was recorded c.2003), the production is sloppy and the band does sound off at times. If you want Starship's greatest hits, seek out the three studio albums, 'Ten Years and Change,' or 'The Very Best of Starship - We Built This City.' NOT this. This isn't the Starship you remember from the 1980s and early 1990s.Buy it if you are a curious Starship fan that wants to know what Mickey Thomas has been up to lately. Otherwise, avoid.
i recently bought pacific digital's drumxtreme with all intentions of using this product as a beginner's tool.  i hate to say that i am dissapointed with it though.  for starts, the software that comes with it hardly works, meaning the &quot;music game, etc.&quot; doesn't work, so therefore one cannot play along with music.  all it basically does is let you bang on the drums and try to figure out things for yourself.  so why not get real drums instead?  this product promises a good beginner's experience but does not deliver it.  the sound is not good quality, and the toms are barely audiable.  not to mention that this model doesn't come with a hi hat pedal, leaving the beginner to use their arm - which complicates things in the beginning and could leave one frustrated.  sure, there are other models that offer this, but for one who is on a budget and just looking to begin drums, this one seems like the best bet.  i personally wish i would've kept my money and used it on real drums instead, which i am going to have to do now.  so save yourself the trouble, if you want to begin - begin on real drums and get the real experience, dont be fooled by this product.
This is the possibly the only thing I've ever bought and immediately thrown away.  Piano is ghastly.  Her voice cracked my Coke bottle.
This AT440ML cartridge has been discontinued and is no longer available. The replacement is AT440MLa. If you order this item you will be getting he 440MLa which has a frequency response of 20Hz-20KHz, and not the 5Hz-32KHz advertised. The seller (Electronics Expo) does not tell you this or respond when they are emailed. Be Aware.
I ordered a Pyle PLTTB1 belt drive turntable on Amazon, and it didn't work at all.The motor was very loud and the tone arm would not move across the record.It would just stay in the outside grooves. A place to send the turntable was included,but I have no record whatsoever of the transaction. I have nothing to showwhere or when I bought it.I bought another turntable since then on Ebay, and it works great.So, now I'm stuck with the bad one.
first act products are all really cheap, they suck, the quality is very poor if you are looking for something with even a little bit of quality do not buy this set
I got this microphone about a month ago because im building a little home studio and i was looking for something a little cheap to get me started. but anyways i got this microphone its works pretty well, yea the sound quality was decent.but it dropped on the floor. not mistaken ive tooken very good care of this thing it havent never touched the floor ever, and the on and off cutoff switch broke off of it. nomore mic so if u purchase this mic make sure u dont EVER let it drop on the floor cause u will have to get another one like me. I wouldnt reccommend because u really get what u paid for.
This microphone arrived soon after I ordered it, but it had NO packing material to protect it. The plastic material used for shipping would have been perfect, but certainly did nothing to protect this item from any bouncing or dropping etc. during shipping. Bottom line is that I had paid over $8.00 in shipping and handling to purchase it and another over $8.00 to return it. That was more than the cost of the item itself! It never worked from the first time we tried it. I think I should have been reimbursed for this thing entirely. I would not recommend this to anyone. Go to a different store if you need one and you won't have to deal with Nady Systems.
Bought this NADY SP-4C Dynamic Microphone to work with the newly purchased Emerson GQ756 CDG Karaoke Player.  The microphone appeared "open or used" and clearly was not working.  Needed to hold the wire that came out of the microphone a certain way to get any sound to transfer and it was very static.  Clearly the vendor had this open before or it was sent back and I feel like they were trying to pass along a product that was broken.
Bought 4 of these about 6 weeks ago, using them for classroom.  Connection (3 xlr pins) become loose, female cord doesn't connect.  Wouldn't buy again.
Ordered a NADY SP-4C Dynamic Microphone for my nephew's birthday gift, the box was taped up, so it was obvious it was a used gift, this was not the problem.  The microphone doesn't work, I spent an entire day going to electronic stores, they were all very helpful in trying to find out what I needed to make the microphone work but needless to say, I am now stuck with a useless microphone and a very unhappy nephew.
it's good but not that good their are some electric problems with it. I rated it because I liked it!(MADE IN CHINA)!!
This mic sucks. I thought it looked like a good deal, but it was just money for a toy. Lame!
I regret to Report the non - Dynamic aspect worked briefly, now failed. The Dynamic aspect did not work from Day 1.The Mike will be returned to Amazon, Nady or Goodmans???
Immediately the connection was poor on one and within a week the other was faltering.  I bought 2 lifetime warrantied cables instead, attached them to the same cables the Nady XC-10's were, and they work great!
Upon removing supposedly "new" unit from box, discovered marred "level" adjustment screw indicating prior misuse. Unit did not work because of poor transmission and faulty female jack plug on transmitter. More than 30 days elapsed between the time I bought the unit and when it was first used and the vendor selling thru Amazon refused to honor a refund or replacement citing their obscure return policy. This device is poorly constructed, cheaply made, non-functional and, in my opinion, misrepresented as factory new when it appeared to be otherwise.
You will notice that the description on this page describes this item as a dual disc.  Friends recommended this title to me, as supposedly the dual disc contains a nice surround mix.  However, I have no way of knowing that, because the label that released this decided to drop the dual disc, release it as a plain CD, and NOT CHANGE THE ISBN NUMBER!!!!!!Would it really have been that difficult to actually create a UNIQUE ISBN NUMBER FOR A UNIQUE PRODUCT?Now how the heck am I supposed to know what I'm going to get when I order this?  How many CDs am I going to have to buy to find the dual disc?So, take this as a warning, when ordering this item, there's no telling what kind of disc you will actually get.
I was recently in the market for a DJ software package so I could transition into MP3 dj-ing.  I thought PCDJ was the best software on the market, clearly I was wrong.  When the software was functioning (rarely), the features that first attracted me to it worked fine.  Then, things went downhill from there.  First off, PCDJ has a sound dropping issue.  Whenever one would maximize or minimize a window, the sound would stutter or skip, producing a horrendous noise.  Visiosonic has addressed the issue, but has yet to produce a fix.  It also turns out Visiosonic has a ridiculous licensing/product activation system that will lock you out of the application by changing even the slightest settings to your system's hardware (BIOS update or a video card driver update for example).  I paid $300 for PCDJ FX and now I can't use it.  Tech support was an absolute joke; it took them one week to respond to my inquiry and finally unlocked my software.  After the same thing happened again about a month later, I decided to forget about PCDJ all together.  Think twice before purchasing any Visiosonic product, it's just not worth the money.  Sadly enough, the application lockout happened right before one of my DJ jobs, a very embarrassing situation indeed.  Look at other software packages (heck, even iTunes is better than this) before stooping to this.
I would not buy this CD if it wouldn't have been for the one and only song I always been listening to "Voyage Voyage".  Its great song but the rest of them I didn't like.  Besides they were (most of them) in French
Ahead made some very robust programs about four years ago.  I have no idea how they fell off like they did, but they certainly hit bottom pretty hard.  Perhaps they suddenly decided that burning files to CD wasn't important, and they decided to add a bunch of other half-baked features to their program while its core got all soft.  Perhaps they used all the money they got from hardware manufacturers who bundled Nero with their drives to snort so much blow that their brains fell out through their sinuses.  Perhaps they just started employing less than adequate Indian programmers to write different parts of the program and then proceded to paste it together with old gum.  It is a mystery. Unsuprisingly enough, Nero 7 is even worse.  It's like the signal to noise ratio is losing badly.  It already takes two updates just to get it to do the basic things right and then only half of the time.  At this rate, Nero 8 will be declared a menace to global stability and will be removed by any competent virus protection.Avoid.This.Program.Anyone who tells you different was probably paid to.
To sum up my Nero 6 Ultra Edition experience:1. The user interface is NOT user-friendly.2. The program documentation is in two different and unrelated places - Windows help and three different pdf files found only on the installation disc.3. When I have a problem, I have yet to find what I am looking for in the included program documentation.4. The Nero suite is not integrated well. The user must already know which programs in Nero do exactly what the user wants to do with CD burning... and pray you know how to do your desired task.5. FAQs at the website are not helpful6. There is no telephone tech support included in the purchase price. You can get it, but it will cost you per minute!7. The included Tech support is only available via email with a 5 - 7 day wait between your submission and the Tech reply. Email tag is reduced if you  are VERY CLEAR about what you need to know or do.8. There is at least one good thing about Nero 6 Ultra Edition... I have yet to make a coaster.9. GOOD LUCK NEW USERS!
This is an awful product. I have wasted countless hours (not to mention spindles of blank media) trying to get the most basic tasks accomplished. Burning DVD-Video is a joke. I have only got this function to work a couple of times, and even then it never happened without several attempts. The program would fail to recognize certain video files, or burn to anything up to 98% completion before declaring an error message, or more-often-than-not simply freeze up the computer.I wish I had done my research before buying this - I had heard that Nero had a good reputation. Based on what I now know that's due to change.I took another reviewers advice and looked into Intervideo and it is excellent. I burned a DVDR this afternoon that Nero claimed it was unable to do. Not only that but it but completed the job in under 10 minutes (I had waited for anything up to 1hr 45 mins on Nero).You'd be a fool to waste good money on this junk.
This product was only a means by which you had to purchase other modules in order to make use of the item.  This was not the advertised $89.00 version.  I was very dissatisfied with this worthless bait and switch.
I purchased Nero 6 Ultra Edition with high hopes. Unfortunately the software has many application conflicts running on Windows 2000 (current service pack), inablity of InCD to format or erase CD-RWs, and suffers from poor technical support.Nero support's attempts to help me were good at first. They even sent me software to help resolve the conflicts with applications and direct writing to my my Plextor CD-R drive. Unfortunately even the software they sent to assist me didn't operate as they indicated it would. After a few back and forths, Nero support essentially threw up their hands and gave up.So I removed Nero 6 Ultra and installed Roxio Easy CD Creator. Now not only are my conflicts gone, but Windows Explorer file copies to CD-RWs have gone from six minutes (Nero 6 Ultra) to 30 seconds (Roxio Easy CD Creator).Nero can fiddle all they want, but I will stay out of Rome!
This is one of the buggiest set of applications for burning DVDs I have ever used.Ahead software used to put out the best burning software on the market when CD-R was the big thing. Now that DVD burning is in, what has happened to Nero? I spent $50 on this? A program that hangs every single time I try to make a DVD? There is no way anyone should have to pay $1.29 for technical support for a product like this.Want to make menus for a home DVD? Forget it, the app will hang every time. Want to simply burn a data DVD? Forget it. Feel like getting burned out of $50, then buy this. Trust me, you will regret it.Buyer beware - once you open it, no store will allow you to return it. I'm actually going to call my credit card company and see if they can help. You should be ashamed Ahead software.
I mistakenly thought because the title of this page was Nero 6 Ultra, that I would only be offered that product. So, I was lured by the low prices of what I thought was the product I was looking for. I paid a little over six bucks (including shipping) for Nero 6 OEM. Now I've got two copies. My bad, but it is a mistake that is easy to make. So, be careful with your order.Anyone want Nero 6 OEM ... cheap?
Try MyDVD instead. Fork out for a professional editing suite. Take up golf. But don't bother with this mish mash. Everything is promised; NOTHING is delivered. I've spent months with this and burned nothing to disk yet. I have spent more on wasted media getting nowhere with this software, way more than the software cost. Tech support is a joke. Slow beyond belief. You email them, they email you the next day. Unless of course you emailed after tea or on the weekend or some other time that might actually suit YOU. Their solutions (usually amounting to no more than uninstall/reinstall) don't work. You email them again. If you're lucky, they email you back. Can you imagine how many steps there could be to arriving at a solution? Now double or triple that figure. And that's how many days it could take to get this thing going. I still haven't and I've been at it for a month. I wonder if anyone gets it working? Only reason I gave it 1 star is because there's no way to give it a big fat zero.
I bought the OEM Suite (it included an expired demo version of the wav editor). I called customer service and was told to purchase MP3pro for $20 to fix the problem. Then, after downloading and not installing properly, I was prompted to go to EXTRAS and Encoding (no encoding). Tried to reinstall, it wouldn't let me. Nero tech support charges $1.29 a minute to help you solve this problem. It's called "throwing good money after bad". STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!
This Nero software came with my sony 800 DVD writer. I could not get this software to do anything for me. It would not recognize even the DVD drive although it is fully comfortable with my Sony Laptop. All I was getting was error messages. I went on the internet and downloaded a free trial of Intervideo software and it worked flawlessly. I was very happy after 2 days of frustruations I had trying to get the NERO software to work.
My daughter received this as a Christmas Present...the only &quot;toy&quot; she received...CD compartment won't open.  Have been everywhere (every day since Christmas) to find one to exchange it with.  None available at this time...how devastating!  What a disappointment!
I am shocked that such a nice-looking item bearing the Memorex name could be so shoddy.  I bought three MKS8501's at Target for nieces and nephews.  I'm glad I tried them out before sending them off to completely suckify three different households on Christmas morning!For a few minutes the simple array of buttons did nothing.  Then, for a few minutes it functioned, with mediocre results.  Then the CD drive whizzed and rattled, the screen went gray, and no controls functioned.  I will be returning these units to Target with a CDG stuck inside one of them.This crashing disappointment follows the mail order purchase of a similar product, the Craig CG8312, from Toys R Us via Amazon.com.  All three of those units were dead out of the box, and gave off the same dangerous aroma of overheating circuits after a few minutes.  I suspect that both of these Craig and Memorex products come from the same soulless conglomerate, perhaps even manufactured in the same high tech sweatshop in China.Target should take the Memorex junk off its shelves immediately.  [...].  It is horrifying to imagine a kid getting one of these lousy karaoke machines and their only big Christmas gift.
I will admit I wasn't expecting that great of quality from this low-end machine (purchased at Target for around $50&#60;br /&#62;However, my low expectations were not met.  &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;The biggest issue is that in order to hear the people singing you need to turn their volume to Max and have the echo in the middle.  Another issue is that you need to sing very close to the microphones in order for it to pick up your voice (the unit came with one; we purchased one extra and had same issue with both).  This causes the sound to get quite distorted. I would also agree with the person who indicated 5 watts does not provide enough power.  But for the kids playing in the front room it was sufficient.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;The kids love singing so they don't seem to mind.  We didn't have any of the other issues described.  Yes, it only comes with 1 CD with a few sample songs, but I believe it was clearly labeled on the box and for this price what do you expect?&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;We only had one other technical issue with a CD we purchased in that one song didn't play right.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;In summary, I would recommend reading some of the reviews on higher-priced models and see if you get a better bang for your buck.
It SAYS it works with the Mac but, after spending WAY too much time than should be necessary trying to get this to work, I could not get the software and hardware to properly install.  I can install the software, but I can't connect the hardware.  The moment I connect the hardware the screen gets this grey veil that drops down over everthing, making the computer useless, and indicating that I must hold down the power button to restart.  I do this and when the computer comes back online it merely tells me to restart again.  This item has ZERO support with a real person.  Understand people, a FAQ that doesn't answer my questions is worthless to me.  I'm a technical writer.  I write documentation for a living.  I found the docs to be disjointed and the software overly complicated.  I will keep hacking away on this to see if I can get it to run, but I've already spent way too much time on it with absolutely NO results.  As it stands right now, this is a $100 POS that I will be returning if I can't get it to function.  My advise to Line 6 ... get a support line ... even a support chat line ... or hire some decent writers that can provide some sense of order to your doc ... because it sucks.
I, like many others, have a SoundBlaster card. Cakewalk has numerous problems with SoundBlaster. It took me two hours to figure out how to just get some sound out of Cakewalk. I recorded a ten second vocal test but it wouldn't play back, nothing came out. Turns out there's some deeply embedded setting you have to change in the software that you can only figure out after hours of searching through online chat-rooms.The metronome doesn't work through the speakers, it only comes out of the PC's internal speaker or MIDI. Being a musician I have no need for MIDI.I'm a 16-year techie who happens to also be a musician. This is one of the worst pieces of software I have used in my entire adult life. If you're a musician who just wants to sit down, press record, play some music, stop, play it back, tweak it a little, add more tracks, etc....sounds simple right? Don't buy this software. You will be screaming at the top of your lungs for a whole day and then putting it on eBay in an attempt to try and recoup the $150 you just spent on it.
i have tried so many times to get this stupid thing to work and there is nothing!!!!!!! and now it's too late to return it! don't buy it!
dont buy it, it cut out your voice.the cable itself look good but internally is no good at all. Find other brand. I thought this is good enough but at the end money is dog gone even it is less than $14.
This CD was recorded at way too low volume. The CDs in my car play between volume levels 18 and 24; to get the same volume, this one had to play at 40. Then, there were sections that were so quiet that I had to turn the speakers all the way up just to make sure that silence wasn't recorded.When you turn it over it says "My Fatherland (excerpts)". This is fine, but it does not deserve the primary title of The Moldau.
This piece is played much too slow and is totally lacking in life.I would like to return it if I could.
Genaux did a beautiful recording of Farinelli for Harmonia Mundi where her agile and well-schooled voice was a perfect match. Now to shift to bel canto ? A major drawback. She is a baroque singer, in the bel canto repertoire her voice sounds punny, she lacks volume both in the lower and higher register. There is an audible break in her higher notes which sound totally out-of-focus. I hope she records more Handel, Mozart, etc that is her true Fach.
Received item broken when it was listed as like new condition. Picture clearly shows two microphones but i received only one and it was broken. Karaoke player was horribly scratched and dirty. Very disappointing!
I have a Dell XPS with a CDRW and DVD+RAM. The system is working perfectly, but when I install MusicMatch 8 Pro is disables my DVD.  Dell support got it working by restoring the system back to right before I installed MusicMatch.  Tech support did notrespond to my help request from their online website.
I'm in the same situation as Briface.  I am a paid for Ver 8 customer and also subscribed to their radio service for a couple of years.  I go to use my Super Tagging and it is blocked by a popup window telling me my super tagging "subscription" expired.  What subscription?  I never agreed to any subscription!  I PAID for features and now they are unilaterally taking them away!!  I can't even rename files from manually entered tag data.  This uses none of Musicmatch's resources but is blocked by their stupid popup.Beware this company.  Their business model is to make you think you paid for something, then suddenly take it away from you and offer to reinstate it for a "subscription fee".Does anyone know how much this subscription costs?  There is absolutely nothing on Musicmatch's website and clicking on their popup yields a dead page.  They are asking you to sign up for a subscription but they won't tell you how much it costs.  Give me a break.  I can't believe how sleazy these guys have gotten.I'm not sure what recourse as usere we have.  I may try the BBB like another poster.  I think we should all be writing to PC Magazine too to let them know that this "editor's choice winner" of theirs is involved in shady business practices.
Momma always said, "if you ain't got nothin nice to say, don't say nothin at all."
Finale. Grrr. This software is badly designed. It is too hard to learn (I can't be that stupid, I did graduate from Yale). It doesn't make sense. It doesn't conform to straight forward software behavior standards that we expect like with Word, Photoshop, Pro Tools, etc. It looks kind of old and dumpy in the interface. Way too many buttons and toolbars and dialog boxes. Like the program itself, the Help is difficult to navigate and hard to decipher. There is a new version every year - but the usability doesn't ever improve - except for really simple things. (They added a &quot;Start New Score&quot; wizard. Oh boy!)
The program will not run on Win 7. It might not even run on Win XP. I was able to install the program on Win 7, but it crashes before you can do anything. Skip it and buy their new Ejay products.
I want to advise you that DJ MIX STATION doesn't have too many resources and it MIXES, doesn't MAKE music.
I had the same experience as the person who had to go into regedit and tweak stuff to get this puppy to work. And then they won't give support over the phone -- only by email! Originally I was going to buy Roxio, but was successfully sidetracked by the cheaper price of Pyro. Ooops. I'm going to the computer store where I bought this thing to buy a copy of Roxio or Xing.I'm giving it one star here because they won't let me give it none.
I bought this device with the intention of using it with my Dell Inspron B130 laptop.  When my computer would not read the disc with the drivers, I took everything to the computer techs at the local Staples Office Supply store.  They also had problems with the drivers and ended up downloading them from M-Audio.  Even after the drivers were loaded, the techs were not able to get my computer to recognize the device.  In fact, when they plugged the device in, it caused my computer to shut down.  Needless to say, I returned it for a refund.
I ordered this the same day I ordered a guitar from Guitar Center, If you see "Email for availability" on a web page you are ordering from that means its back ordered. After 20 days of waiting they sent an email stating it was going to be another 30 days. I shopped real stores and bought a beautiful Stratocaster.  BUT by that time my 30 day warranty was up and the M-Audio bearly functions. The head phone jack has to be pulled out in just this special place to work; the USB connection  crackles and cuts out completely sometimes.  My musician friends are back in town and say Line 6 is better.  No matter I'm very happy to be playing again.  The delay gave me time to realize I needed good instrument that is a joy to play and I got this sweet Fender instead of the 150 buck bargain. Oh! the M-Audio was a refurbish...NO bargain
i have had this unit for 2 years and have never been fully satisfied with its usability.  i work with mac and pc laptops and firewire drives in creating video and audio.  anything plugged into your firewire ports other than the 410 will cause driver errors.  m-audio has known about conflicts with the 410 and using a mac's firewire 800 ports for years and have done nothing to remedy the problem.  on the pc the driver will mysteriously punk out in the middle of a session.  my experience with customer support was some blather about the "complexity of professional soundcards".  save yourself the money and headaches and invest in another unit.
I got this interface to play live shows with my synthpop group.  I've used plenty of other recording interfaces and fixed countless problems with them, but the problems with this interface seem to be unfixable.The audio skips and crackles.  Sometimes the unit will stop working in the middle of a performance.  I have to restart the computer to fix it.I haven't heard of this problem anywhere else, but mine buzzes loudly every time my laptop accesses the hard drive.It looks like some people don't have problems with this interface, but it's definitely a gamble.  This is the only piece of M-Audio equipment I've ever had a problem with.
This is by far the worst firewire interface I've had. Worked relatively well for around six months, albeit with occasional blips and pops, and then suddenly died. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Do yourself a favor and buy one of the other inexpensive interfaces out there, or save up a bit more money and buy something like a MOTU, you will just throw your money away with this one.
First, the good things about this interface:When it's working, it is a great unit.  Sound is clean, and I love all the inputs and outputs.  The software is pretty good, and gives you a lot of options for routing and tweaking.  Notice I said the software is good, not the drivers.The Bad:As I said, "when it's working", which is actually not very often.  If you plan to dual-boot between Mac and Windows, forget this unit.  Every time you boot into OSX, it will pause to upgrade the firmware, then you have about a 50/50 chance of it working, and if it doesn't, you'll have to reboot.  Then, you have about an 80/20 chance of it working.  When you boot into Windows again later, it probably won't get recognized.  You'll be greeted with a flashing blue light that says the unit won't connect.  Then you have to reboot.  If you're lucky, it will actually work on the second or third reboot into Windows.  Are you starting to get the picture?Now, with most units, this wouldn't be a big problem.  You could just unplug it and replug it, and the computer would recognize it.  Except that if you "hot-plug" the 410, meaning plug it in while the computer is running, you will most likely fry your firewire port, making it inoperable for ANY firewire device.  Check the support documents on M-Audio's site and you'll see that they know about this issue, and they warn you against it.So now we have a unit that not only won't connect about 50-70% of the time, but you can't unplug and replug it, which is the most common fix for this problem.  Sounds like a winning combination, doesn't it?As if this wasn't enough fun, I just started having an issue where Logic seems to disconnect this unit altogether.  Whenever I try to play anything in Logic, the unit disconnects, and no audio will play in ANY program from that point on.  This COULD be a problem with Logic, and it could be something I did, but given this unit's reputation for problems, I'm inclined to place the blame there.M-Audio's quality used to be pretty good, but in the last few years, they just can't get their act together at all.  Drivers are terrible, they STILL don't have Vista drivers for most of the products over a year later, and their products seem to just get cheaper and cheaper all the time.Stay far away from this unit.  Don't be lured in by the extra outputs.  You can get much better quality for the same price, and if you need all the outputs, just spend a little more for a better brand.
Giordani can be excellent in the theater, but this album seems to have caught him at a bad time.  He always seems to be changing gears during his performances here.  He seems to have several voices in each register and you don't know from one minute to the next what you are going to get.  I found this album to be a very unpleasant listening experience and think it was a mistake for Giordani to let Naxos issue it.If you want to hear a better performance by Giordani, pick up a copy of Verdi's Jerusalem on Philips which catches him in much better vocal estate.
I ordered one of these about a week ago. I have used the vocal version, the PG-58, for a number of years and have had good luck with it; for the price I don't think you can beat it. I ordered the PG-57 because I have a guitar without a pickup and didn't want to install one. I thought I would use the PG-57 instrument mic for that purpose, instead. I also ordered a clip-on boom to hold the PG-57 on the same stand that holds the PG-58. When I tried the PG-57 I immediately noticed a large amount of noise every time I touched it, the mic stand, or even the wooden floor underneath. This did not happen with the PG-58, which is on the same stand, with the same type of mic clip, going into the same PA system with the same type of cable. I unscrewed the PG-57's wind screen and found that the body of the mic is rigidly inserted into the casing with a metal washer surrounding it. I also unscrewed the PG-58 in the same way, and found that its body sits in a very soft, cushioned rubber holder that sort of floats in the casing. There is little wonder that the PG-57 has a noise problem, but the PG-58 doesn't.I looked online and found that there are a lot of counterfeit Shure mics available for sale. I don't know if Amazon has gotten some of these instead of the real thing, which seems unlikely, but who knows? I checked on the Shure web site and they still advertise that both the PG-57 and PG-58 have internal anti-shock mounts, so I don't think they have changed the design to what I found, which in any case would ruin their reputation for quality. This leaves the possibility that this was a manufacturing defect, but it also would seem unlikely for anyone to substitute a metal ring for a rubber shock mount.I of course returned the PG-57 to Amazon and noted the reason for return as a condensed version of what I have expressed above. I'm not sure how much attention the return department pays to something like this, so this review was the only other way I could find to tell the story. I hope someone from Amazon will see this and follow up on it, particularly with the specific unit that I returned. In the meantime, if you order this item please be warned that it may have the same problem that I found.
This is my first amp. It's a lot smaller than I thought it would be but it sounds great and looks cool tooUpdate:After a few months, the speakers broke, and the only noise produced now is static.
Bought these in September looking for find some good cheap headphones with good sound quality and, block exterior noises as well as for occasional hobby DJing. They did a great job while they lasted. 4 months later I only have sound out of my right ear. Never yanked on the or mistreated them at all. Just one day stopped working. I'm sure it's a loose wire somewhere inside but coming from Numark I would expect a lot better quality, and not have to take them apart. Comfort above the head is OK, a little uncomfortable when you wear them around the back. Sound is also decent.Would not recommend these even for the cheap price. They can be all okay, but if they break after 4 months it's not worth the money IMO.
just wasnt happy or clear it was only a demo version so was to happy i couldnt use the product for more then 7 days.......
Received it in time, standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days. Since I was out of 30 days return time, sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today.
I used this cable maybe 5 times before it just stopped working for no apparent reason, bad quality I suppose.
Cord had to be pinned in certain position to not static the Microphone system, did test to verify that it was the Cord not he microphone.
This mic cable was DOA. I will avoid purchasing Pyle products in the future.Just go to Guitar Center and buy a Live Wire cable, it's not as long but at least it works.
Rather than being made to the dimensional tolerances necessary for a solid and secure fit, this cable's connectors were designed with a lot of 'slop', in the hope that a flimsy pressed metal spring cap will take up the slack and somehow be secure. It simply doesn't work. The result is a loose mechanical fit which will certainly introduce noise into your system as the contact pins move relative to one another.After years and hundreds of Amazon purchases I am amazed that Amazon would sell this item. It is simply unfit for its intended purpose.Thanks to Amazon Prime's return policy I don't expect any problem returning this. In the final analysis it is Amazon which will sustain the loss, but don't waste your time with this cable. Amazon offers superior cables for a few bucks more.
Spend the money and get a better one.  I had to throw them all away.  They all shorted after 6-8 months of use.
I've been trying to contact the seller and finally filed a claim on the seller because Mine never came. So I recommend you don't buy this from deals mania.
Unable to review product due to a cosmetic (chip in the head of the guitar) defect that apparently not noticed at the manufacturer.
Deal or not, if you are serious... you do not buy a guitar in this price range.  And I do not mean serious in terms of wanting to really be a pro guitarist... I just mean, if you are serious in trying to learn guitar... do not.  These things are always overly cheap and unplayable.  I have a few cheap models of Silvertone guitars that are for display purposes only (signed by artists) and, trust me, as a guitarist who owns many guitars, I cant even play these things. They are so cheap, the strings do not stay in tune, usually have intonation problems (cant clear frets and thus buzz and pop or never have proper note frequences at all the frets).  They usually always feel cheap too and the feel does affect the playability and tone.  If you want to really learn you have to pay at least a little more and go for better brands.  I would recommend anyone serious in learning to never buy a guitar that costs under $300... you are just wasting your money and the problems and limitations may even frustrate you and work against you learning how to play.  Go for the brands that are made by the bigger dogs... like ESP's LTD brand... Gibson's Epiphone brand, or Fender's lower brand (Squire?).  There are other examples.  I am sure Ibanez has some good lower models (though I am not sure they have a lower brand name for their cheaper gear).  If you do have to go for a cheaper brand, at least then buy their top of the line models (this pertains to Dean, for example).  But for me, brands like Silvertone and Archer... are just plain no good for real use.
We tried TWO of these!  The first one arrived damaged, but it was clear from the packaging that it was already damaged when it was packaged to be sent to us.  The second one had a bent neck; so badly arced that the music store said that it was "unplayable"!  Both of them cruddy.  Amazon made good on their guarantee and we are getting a refund and were able to return both at no cost, but what a mess; it was a Christmas gift.  Stay FAR AWAY from this manufacturer!
I was excited when I saw that I could get a guitar and amp with accessories for a good price, so I went ahead and purchased it. When I received the guitar everything seemed fine, although the guitar-amp cable was broken. After replacing it, I found that the first 2 frets on the guitar did not work. The sound that came out when I played these frets was just an annoying buzz. I immediately tried to contact the company, Silvertone Guitars, but never received a reply. The only contact information I have been able to find on their website is a single email address and a note stating that their contact form is unavailable. I have attempted to contact them with my complaints several times, but to no avail. I am greatly bothered by the fact that this company ships out crappy guitars then completely ignores customer complaints.TL;DRThe Guitar was a piece of crapThe Company, Silvertone Guitars, has almost no working contact information to do anything about thisThe Company seems to be unwilling to offer any form of customer service
The item was decribed as in "Good" or "Like New' condition. Since I am an amateur, the significant problems with this item were not immediately apparent. It now requires professional repair, at a cost nearly equal to the price of the unit.I am very displeased.
silvertones suck. theyre heavy. as in weighs a lot. but they're pretty, if thats all you're going by.
My daughter was very excited to recieve her new bass kit. Then quickly DISAPPOINTED. As we were trying to tune the bass, we just could NOT get it to tune. We realized the neck of the bass was warped and bent. So we sent it back for a replacement. We received the new bass kit in a day. Again very excited. The new bass tuned well and was not bent, we then plugged it in to the AMP and .... NOTHING. No sound. The AMP did not work at all. Needless to say, we returned everything for a refund. Was not happy with this product. We will be looking elsewhere for a new one.
bought this and took it to be set up at the guitar center it is not worth it went there and wnded up getting a better guitar at the same price no amp but I would rather but it spererate and have a bass that works and sounds good not just throw $ at the wind and have a piece of junk to show for it. ;(
Bass guitar neck broke  in half first day received. Did not play strings were rusted and the amp made a loud huming noise.
This is my first review and feel bad its a negative one. After shopping around for months I finally found the bass I wanted. The picture of the Silvertone LB11 showed a Cobalt/Dark Blue body, gold bridge, gold strings, gold keys, all gold hardware and lettering. The look of gold on dark blue sold me. When the bass arrived it wasn't the same one depicted in the picture, no gold anything, all silver. It's said a picture is worth a thousand words, but in this pictures case its just one word, deceptive! One very,very disappointed customer.Silvertone LB11 Bass & Amp Package, Cobalt/Dark Blue
Cushion has one third thickness of what shown in the picture. It is not easy to adjust height. You need your own tool unscrew the screw. Do not plan to share with yuor family member who needs seat adjustment on the fly.
I bought 2 of these headphones for my 20 and 23 year-old sons (both musicians).  They had been highly recommended by a salesman at Guitar Center, who said they were widely used in recording studios.  The sound quality was ok and they fit the head very comfortably, but the game-breaker was the volume.  Neither set played loud enough...we tried plugging into iPads, iPods, computer, and direct from a keyboard.  With everything turned up &#34;to 11&#34;, they weren't loud enough.  We had thought the first set we tried was faulty, but then the second set was exactly the same.  Amazon was great about the return, even though both sets had been opened.
Very tinny sounding and this is on quality tracks... not mp3's. If you like bass/bass accentuation don't bother. The only music I can really stand hearing with these is classical. Also, they are surprisingly quiet. I am generally sensitive to loudness but I found, even when at their max, to be weak with some tracks. I am surprised at how many positive reviews there are of these headphones. They just don't do it for me. I'm sending them back.
The sound on these headphones is fine for the price, the negative aspect of this is a complete deal breaker for me and people with long hair as this isn't an uncommon occurrence with this headset. The mechanism which expands the band of the headphones rests on the gold round piece on the cups, and if you have long hair it will inevitably get caught in between that and when you try to remove the headset you will rip some hair off.. This is overly frustrating that the majority of people are writing good reviews based on the sound rather than the construction, although I assume most have short hair hence their positive review. Before buying these headphones I had never considered that this type of construction would be a negative, but after wearing these for over a year I am thoroughly fed up and will always check to make sure that I don't make this mistake again in the future. My hair is no longer even and the hair that gets caught is noticeably shorter than the rest, since it happens often. This construction is disgustingly awful and If I prevent at least 1 person from buying these blunt scissors with speakers then this review was worth the write.
Apparently, muddy is the new sound of headphones these days.  I once bought a pair of AKGs back in the 80's, they sounded wonderful for years.  These sound like they are covered in a down pillow. even after tweaking and tuning the sound cards EQ, they still sound horrible  its not the AKG im used to hearing,  save your money, buy something else.
..to the reviewer before me, what are you recording into?Generally you don't use Windows Mixer to engineer your masterpiece...you would control the levels in your sequencer software, such as ProTools, Sonar or even CoolEdit!!But never windows...
This device works just fine, but if you want to use the digital output for dolby or dts passthrough on mac os x, forget it. It works with system drivers that do not allow for surround sound
Please don't buy it. This thing is old and you can find much better produts of Aerosmith (take a look at Lick Library for instance). There are 40 riffs. First they show it normal speed, then slow motion with zoom. I would say the worst part is that they show you a short riff, but without specifying which song it comes from. Off course some riffs you can identify, but others I just dont know where they come from. The level of difficulty is basic to intermediate.
After repeated listening to this I have decided to rid myself of it. One track is good: the interpretation of Johnson's 'Cold was the night, dark was the ground'.  The attempt at a fusion of 'blues', non-existent rag and raga misses the mark hopelessly. Want raga? Then get some raga! There's a stack of excellent stuff available. If I may draw a comparison: Muse trying a symphony on their 2nd last album 'The Resistance'. Doesn't work. Sorry. Rather listen to the countless real symphonies available. Or listen to maestros like Focus, Yes and PFM who in their prog-rock did achieve something of the same stature as a real symphony. You really have to be a genius like John Mc Lachlan to fuse things as disparate as jazz, rock and Indian music. And here we have Jack Rose trying to fuse the blues, country guitar (God help us all!) and raga. Tall order. Not delivered. God bless his soul. PS: If you have the space to spare and would like to purchase the most pretentious, verbose liner note review, just try Kisan Nagai's review of 'Red horse, white mule'  - jeez! - it is as nebulous as the music, but actually quite collectable. (Kisan Nagai  is a 'blues scholar'.) The review of  'Opium Musick' by Joe R. Sacks (another 'blues scholar'), on the other hand, is far more sober, modest and sensible. Oddly, no date of publication appears on the liner notes.
I bought this item & the transpose function didn't work - might be a problem w/ the product - I know someone else who has the same problem.  So, I sent it in for repair per their instructions.  But, Casio repair service is the worst I've ever seen. They're even worse than Best Buy & that's pretty bad. They rec'd my item for warranty work on 11/23/04. At first I was told the turnaround for the repair was 5-10 business days. Then I was told that starts from the log date. THEN, I was told that it's 10-15 business days from the log date!!! They didn't even get around to logging it in until 12/7/04!!! They had the product 9 business days prior to even logging it in!!! I may never see my product again. So beware, if you purchase something from them, I hope you never have to have it repaired!

The title says it all.  I tried to scan in a couple of solo accompniments.  After following the recommendations for gray scale and such I think I got good scans.But the interpretation was not good.  Only the far left measures down the page could be played.  It skips a lot.  The timing was all screwed up.I would think that with very simple pieces it might perform.  But this is definitely a no go for me.
I wish I would have read the reviews that said this worked a few times, then didn't, because that's exactly what ours did.  It was great the first 3 times or so we used it, but now it randomly flickers even at the fastest speed.  It's very frustrating!!I was thinking about getting another one, but now know not to get a Chauvet.
My son wanted this for Christmas really bad.  It looked good, but when it arrived one of the turntables didn't work at all.  We wanted to try to exchange the product to give it one more chance, but I can't get Amazon to return my email to them.  This item didn't show up as a purchase so I couldn't use their "easy to return" policy.  Apparently they know I purchased it since I've been asked for a review.  I really would like to exchange it and try again, but because of the difficulties I've encountered, my advice would be to not purchase electronics from Amazon or you could get stuck with a piece of equipment that doesn't work!
I bought this subwoofer to share the load with another powered subwoofer. I wanted something economical and functional for small dance hall settings. I needed something on the other side of the room that provided a balance of power- if you will. I realize Pyle products are entry level but, I was curious to learn the quality of bass a $100 subwoofer could reproduce. The product description said it had a built in crossover. Therefore, I expected it to play nothing but bass. However, these Pyle subs don't. To my disappointment, I heard vocals! No subwoofer with a built-in crossover should pump mid-range frequencies. Be warned, when you buy this Pyle product, what you're actually getting is a loudspeaker and not a subwoofer. Final Grade: F.
first off i see the best in things and this does have some qualities that are ok.You can "hear" it and its bass response is decent.now i wouldnt be doing my job if i didnt say why i dont like them.i bought 6 of them to use as monitors on my small pa. I use them alongside sx ev300's and of course these dont match up but they have very low defined high end, the horn is not clear, the woofer is muddy. the wiring on the jacks are a joke and wired backwards. 2 out of six had different woofers in them.  I am going to try and make these sound better and will report back !Also the actual speaker shipped to you does not match the picture, please amazon fix this.
This product was not what I envisioned based on its description.  Was not helpful at all for a presentation I bought it for.
I got mine the do not work at all and no one will contact me to make it right at all do not waste your time
The needle is not made for any kind of scratch ! It even skips with serato ! You can't even cue/hold  the record in place or it will skip !!!!!! It sucks I would have rated it a zero but the ratings don't go that freakin low!
The C-range frequencies are not illegal to use in USASEE: fcc.gov/cgb/wirelessmicrophones/The Sennheiser mics are great.  Just need an A, B or G band unitnot a C, D or E if you are in the USABuyer be warned.
This is unbelievably poorly designed.  It uses a single string to span two notes making it impossible to tune and keep in tune.  You can get a better sound out of some wooden mixing spoons and 99 cent buckets from the hardware store.  It's such a waste, I don't even want to give it away.
amp still does not work as plugging in to bass line produces nothing...trying to see if wiring is off
My daughter is a huge fan of the Bratz and really wanted this item.  The first one we bought didn't work at all and we had to return it.  The second one we bought worked but only and only if the radio was playing and she was standing pretty close to it.
I bought two for my casio privia 555-R which is almost obsolete. They did not fit. Probably for another model. I returned them.
What a waste of money...It sounds like a poor pirate copy from a broken cd writer.  NO I can't send it back for refund because I will end up paying to ship back and will have to pay both what I saved on shipping for the item when superseller.They also don't give option of contact seller in the multiple list so contact them later...but HARD TO GET ITEMS from Amazon are sold without regard for quanties on hand then they send you reminders that they are out...CAN'T Find Pearls Before Swine or the Use of Ashes though they were listed and now only be private sellers capitalizing on Amazons no longer selling them.Amazon should control quality and make quantities availible as promised.  Ordered a vintage Filix the Cat movie and also ordered several other to get super savings WELLLL not Felix the Cat.Presenting Felix the Cat, Vol. 1 and 2You are BETTER OFF buying from individuals--THEY HAVE TO KEEP FEEDBACK UP OR LOOSE PRIVILAGE...not Amazon, they can do what they please.
Microphone isn't sensitive enough for gaming - too much makeup gain is required for speech to come across as intelligible. As a result, there is too much hiss present!
Ordered this and thought it worked great for the price. Then it broke within a month. I guess you get what you pay for.
Broke after a few months of usage. The wires are way too thin and easily breaks. Don't waste your money.
for the price it is what it is , i wouldve preferred taping a microphone to my chest this mic is so noisy just a receiver simply nothing else
Got it because it was cheap and i read some good reviews. The first time i tried using them my friend who i was talking to said that &#34;you sound like a transformer&#34;.  and because i  cant use it I'm using my cellphone and running a pair of ear-buds into my headphones.
I bought this for use with my Sennheiser headphones. Sensitivity is not "high" by any definition, the gain has to be maxed in Windows to pick up anything at a reasonable level. After doing this though, the quality is acceptable for the price. The problem I had was that the cord fell out of the earbuds, after a week a of light use. Totally broken unless I feel like splicing some wires back together. Junk, don't buy.
As soon as i opened the box, i knew this was going to be a waste of my time.But i wanted to disprove my theory and i immediately tried these out.As i was testing them, i realized the only way i could be heard ingame and inskype,Aim,etc. was if i hold the microphone RIGHT NEXT to my mouth. I also googled for help and got none.horrible microphones, wouldn't recommend these.
The pick ups don't work unless I actually hold the microphone with my lips and talk.  Not worth sending back, should have waiting for my sound blaster z (with mic, and is 100x better than this cheap thing plus it's cordless)
Dudley Moore as ever a master at the piano.The cd is a must for anyone loving jazz that Dudley plays, his death was the greatest loss to jazz music you will ever remember.
nowhere in the description does it say that you have to perchase an amp seratly but you do i was under the inpretion that for 150 bucks it would be good to go as soon as i plugged it into some speekers but boy was i wronge amazon was helpfull but the other company was willing to offer me $15 off the perchase price if i would keep it and not return it. what does that tell you i did keep it but only because they wanted me to pay return shipping costs and would not refund my original shipping so in the long run i would have ended up paying about $30 to return it. i was very dissapointed with their service but i still have a turntable to play my records.
I was execting a better product than what I received since it is a NUMARK product made in the U.K.. The Price was so tempting approx. $66, probably that's what you get when you pay cheap. But regarding the service of amazon, I have no complain about it, everything was smooth till I returned the product.
The turntable feels cheap and flimsy, especially the stylus. It would not play large LPs properly because of uneven platter. Tried to have Numark/Ion stand by their warranty, but they would not respond to email in a timely manner or respond by phone. If you google Numark support, it seems many people have this problem. I will not purchase another Numark or Ion product, and I strongly encourage you not to do so either. Try the Vestax Handy Trax portable turntable instead.
I have a massive record collection, and had continued buying records even after the Aiwa turntable I had stopped working.  I saw this on Amazon and saw it was small, reasonably priced, and had a pitch control.  Initially I played my 7" records on it, and it was just fine.  Once I started playing my 12" records the trouble began.  About halfway through any record I play the pitch begins to waver (subtly speeds up and slows down).  I contacted Numark and told them about the problem.  I got a response telling me I needed to buy a different needle to play 78 RPM records on the turntable.  This was a confusing response as I hadn't even mentioned 78 RPM records in my e-mail (nor do I own any).  So I write again and explain that my question wasn't answered.  So then I'm told I should try to balance the arm properly.  I write back again and say that I mentioned in BOTH my e-mails that the unit I was inquiring about was a PT-01, and this model has a pre-balanced (non-adjustable) arm.  Numark wrote back "oh you're right, just return to dealer".  Unfortunately it's too late for that, and Numark was NO help.  Their customer service 'team' couldn't even be bothered to read e-mails and answer accordingly.  Do not buy this unit, I wasted $100 and now I have to buy a new turntable.  I assure you, it won't be a Numark!
I'd always heard great things about numark products, so I decided to roll the dice on the PT01, a big mistake. The good, is that it is a light weight truly portable turntable. The built in speaker provides pretty good sound for being a small speaker. Why the 1 star? b/c the player is poorly constructed. The shiny top piece is poorly glued on, and pops up rubbing against the record while its playing. This causes the record to wobble and creates a very poor sound. I had to put a weight on the player to keep the piece from popping up in order for it to play properly. Little to say I will be staying away from numark products, and I highly recommend that anyone in the market for a player such as this look else where.
The large silver colored base around the platter would NOT stay in place.  It is only held down by a sticky material underneath it.  The one I purchased was raised up just behind the platter and rubbed on the record.  Very poor quality construction and no final inspection at the factory.  Good luck if you buy one.  I returned mine to Amazon.  It's been over two (2) weeks and I have not received any acknowledgment from Amazon regarding the return.
First off--this IS NOT A PIANO!!! This is a cheap, poor sounding, poorly made electronic keyboard. It is not touch-sensitive--a must when playing anything in the piano repetorie. If you want to take piano lessons--find a qualified teacher in your area--don't rely on a cheap keyboard--it will only set you back if you get serious about music.
I received my Shure Beta 5a and it was well packed and in first class condition.  That was the good news. The bad is that it is a fake.  A Chinese knock off.  How can I tell?  Not so easy at first but a bit of research and you will know what to look for.  These guys are clever so some areas will pass the test but as a whole you will soon realize its a FAKE.1. The weight - First thing I noticed was that it felt very light.  Although this was my first Beta I own several SM58's and you just know something is not correct when you hold it.2. Condition - Basically too good for a used mike especially a workhorse like Shure. OK not a sign that its a fake but.....3. The Blue ring around the top is just like a rubber band and rolls off easily.  Real Beta's are well fixed in place.4. Take off the windscreen and you will notice its quite a tight fit and the capsule binds.  Not good.5. Yellow band around cable at bottom of capsule. Not on original.6. Wiring at capsule on original should be yellow and green not one color as mine is.7. On top of capsule you will have Sure in raised letters but also in white a set of initials in white, the person who put it together, not on fake.8. Pins at base gold (mine are) letters 1,2 and three on each pin, mine are, Shure below bottom pins, yup have that but then above where metal strip is also a letter,  Oops they missed that.This is just a few things I was able to spot.  Weight as I said was the first indicator.  Box packaging Velcro strip and bag all ok along with guarantee.I contacted the sellers and they replied that they investigated and agreed it was a fake.  I would get a full refund.  At time of writing waiting on that. I traveled with this mike as an Xmas gift for someone so will return when I get back,  full refund first would be a nice gesture.  We will see.
Clearly this microphone is for highly specialized purposes.  The description doesn't really tell you that it won't connect to any generic digital recording devices.  It looks like a more modern version of a sound grabber type microphone which could be connected (back in the day) to a tape recorder.  I'd assumed I could connect this to a digital voice recorder (Tascam) to amplify the internal microphone so the recording of a conversation would be more clear.  WRONG!  It's really too bad that it's not much more descriptive and giving examples of what it can and cannot connect to on the other end.  Sadly, I needed something in a hurry for work, thought this would function fine and discovered the night before (when it arrived) that it won't connect to anything a non-musician would own.  This is not for non-esoteric uses.  Beware.
After only 3 months of use, one of the stands no longer supports my JBL SXR speaker. It just slides down to the lowest, unextended position within a matter of 20-30 seconds. Will be seeking warranty service but will sell immediately afterwards. I had my old On-Stage stands for 5 years, and although they weren't as nice looking or as promising as these Ultimates, they were always functional. Will buy another pair of On-Stage stands (and for much less too). Also, the Ultimate bag that holds a pair of these stands didn't fare so well in the 3 months either. Already holes and small nicks throughout. Disappointed.
This is the second rack I bought from Gator and both had defects, seems they can't use a rivet gun. Both had bad rivets in the latches, sent the first one back took forever this one I fixed myself.. never again..
I own 4 that I use for my Mackie SRM-450s and have had numerous zipper problems with every one due to the product's bad design: (1) the bag's cloth material above the wheels (which are too small) is too low to the ground (should be much higher so it never touches the wheels, let alone the ground), which causes scrapes on the zipper and its surrounding material and causes the teeth to bend and/or go off-track, and (2) the material surrounding the inner-side of the zipper is way too wide and interferes with opening and closing it, causing it to frequently get stuck).  Every time I send it back to Gator for repair it costs me over $40 in UPS shipping charges.Because of the defects, it is an extremely unreliable product.  At a recent gig, the zipper refused to budge open and after spending over fifteen minutes on it, I had no choice but to rip it open.  I had not had this bag even one month!!The bag comes with an outer zipper pocket, but I don't use it because when I had put a long heavy duty cord in it, the bag became unbalanced.  I also recommend carrying the bag up and down stairs (which is what I do) -- due to its poor design, you will increase zipper problems if you do anything but roll the bag on a flat surface.Up until now, aside from, at times, the repairs taking longer than desired, repair turnaround time/warranty service was fine.  However, as of yesterday (3/11/10), it appears that I might soon be dealing with a legal issue -- although the bag has a lifetime warranty (when using the bag properly, which I have been doing), they told me that they will no longer be repairing my bags as I have had too many claims.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Of course I have more claims -- I have more than one bag (4 in fact)!Going forward, I will buy the Mackie bags designed specifically for their SRM-450s (too bad they don't have wheels and a handle -- Mackie take note!!) for any additional speakers I buy, and then transport the bag-encased speakers on a rolling cart.
Mic does not pickup anything thats not LITERALLY 1-2 inches away from the muzzle (boost enabled). Worthless. 1-2 inches is being modest too. Ya, no really, under an inch... ya... worthless...
The pickup is horrible. Plugged into the microphone jack of the computer and with the volume turned up all the way the sound is barely audible. Even turning up the volume turned up to the max the sound is still way too low. Tried several computers and a laptop, the only conclusion I can come to is that my microphone is defective. But wait, I have a box of 24 brand new microphones, I tried several, they are ALL bad. These things are bad for me, bad for my users and bad for this planet as they are headed straight for the landfill. Horrible product.
audible hum at seemingly any gain. Tested this with multiple sources and outputs. Hopefully not all the units are like this, because if so they are really really poor mixers. I went with a small, passive mixer instead which does have a 3db insertion loss, but no noise.
Felt nice and solid, and the balance controls had center detents. That's the good news.The bad news is there was a really loud hum on all disconnected inputs, and the power supply jack was intermittent (shut off depending on which way the cord was tugged).I suspect I could have made it work by making up plugs to short all the inputs I'm not using (to prevent them from picking up noise) and arranging it to avoid disturbing the power cable, but that's a bit too much to have to do.
This was horrible. I ordered this as a second tier for my IQ 2000 stand.  It said in the manual that if you need a second tier, order this, so I did.  When I received it, it didn't even come close to fitting. No matter what I tried. I am a mechanical engineer and I know how to adjust things if needed.  This was WAY OFF - not even close to fitting into the stand.  I left two complaints to Ultimate Support with no response.  I have owned Ulitmate Support products for years and always found them to be excellent.  This is just junk.  The IQ 2000 itself seems to work ok, but even with that, the locking plate was mount backwards and would not lock.  I had to disassemble the stand and reverse it myself.  I had to litterlaly machine down the end of the 2nd tier and make my own adapter to get it to fit at all.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS PRODUCT.
This "distortion" pedal is horrible!! It didn't really change the sound of my guitar. No distortion or anything. I certainly would never buy this again.
I purchased this as an inexpensive second Capo to have as a backup when I recently misplaced a Planet Waves Capo. I picked up the Shubb Capo at the same time. The Shub works great, and you can put it on using one hand. The Dunlop is a pain to attach to the neck, and is made cheaply. I would save your money and pop for the Shubb, or the Planet Waves dual action Capo, another one hand on and off design. A few more bucks will make life much easier. If I were to choose one, I would probably go for the Palanet Waves, as it is a great design, and solidly made.
I brought this amp to band practice for the first time, and it lasted about a song and a half before completely going mute. Couldn't get any sound what so ever to come out, and the power light was still on. I was playing at half volume so this certainly should not have been a factor in the amp's demise. I still have no idea what is wrong with it, but will be shipping (at my own expense) it back to the factory to be repaired. The amp, however, sounded great for the 15 minutes it worked. Very dissapointing.
A bit small.  Was concerned the clarinet is being smashed into the case.  In the end it works, but felt it was too expensive for what I got.
These things snap, break and crack like it was their job.  I bought two packs of these picks figuring it was a great deal and they'd last me a bit... but after playing just two sets I have gone through the first pack of 24.  At this rate, 48 picks won't last me a month.  In one song alone I broke three picks.  I've never had a problem with thin picks before, and I went back to the old brand with no problems.  Caveat emptor.
These strings feel terrible when you are used do Dada EJ46.I bought them only because they were cheap, and so they look and feel.Tone is not bad, but it's not playable at all.And did I mention that it has been a week and the tuning is still not stable?
I bought this for a Korg Kronos-X.  Its a bit too small to stay on the keyboard even after adjusting the lanyard many times.  You can get it to stay if you have the right technique and about 5 minutes to attempt to hook one side and catch the other before it snaps off. After just about 2 months the lanyard's elastic string for tensioning is very frail as it has thin spots where the tensioning adjustment has compressed the string.  I am looking for a replacement but all of the ones I can find are about the same.
one of the worst strings I've testedThe sound is so sterile, no bright, no cut thru, no definition. The tension is some acceptable and so is the playability .I cant tell about the string life since I take them out after two or three rehearsals.I expected much more for the price I paid .
For the price I thought it would out perform a graphic EQ. Was disappointed because my EQ was less in price and does much more than this unit.I do not recommend this product
OR IN THE PAINTING!!!I was really disappointed with this item. One reviewer said "NOT VERY BLUE"...I should have listened!!!...Strap is predominantly black, purple and murky yellow. PHOTO of strap is nothing like what was delivered!! Be forewarned.In my case I own a LUNA "Starry Night" SAFARI lightweight travel guitar. This strap is shown in some of the ad material as matching that guitar. IT DOES NOT! Totally different color range!Strap itself is 3inches wide.... tends to be stiff and while strap and mesh are strong enough: the ends-- that attach to the guitar -- are cheap thin vinyl-like material that I would be afraid to use with a heavier guitar: I can't see them holding up. I got this strap to go with a lightweight guitar so I would have been less concerned re the strength, IF the printed part of the strap had been as represented in the photo on the website.But for a heavier guitar... I'd be concerned about the ends as these are some of flimsiest I've seen.I love Van Gogh, the painting, the song by Don McLean and the LUNA Safari "Starry Night" guitar is a wonderful little instrument(great colors! does the painting proud!) and good for travel situations.Very disappointed this strap looked NOTHING like the PHOTOS on the site.
I do not think that this is a "NEW" guitar.But i got it at a good price.So it makes everything kinda okay.
good guitar but when it got it the guitar didn't have the E-string attached, it was no big deal i had it replaced at a local guitar shop for 80 cents but don't buy it from this site go somewhere else or buy it at a store. i highly recommend this guitar but buy it elsewhere.
Fine and beautiful in all ways down to the packing.  Had little problem with playability.  The frets were like sand paper.  It was not finished, it missed QC, whatever.  I'm disappointed as I'v owned Epiphones before and own Epiphones now.  What are they using for fret wire?  Seller took it back and all is fine.
Broke out of the box.  It came out of the factory box, no visual damage. the rhythm switch was broke.
I was on a trip when this arrived, after 3 weeks of having it, i finally decided to tune it. When i was trying to tune the 6th cord, the NUT broke!!!!!, now i know why these guitars where so cheap! i'm very very dissapointed. I couldn't even return it since it passed almost 4 weeks.----------Estaba de viaje cuando llego, despues de 3 semanas de tenerla guardada, por fin me decid&iacute; a afinarla. Cuando estaba afinando la sexta cuerda, el hueso se rompio!, no pod&iacute;a creerlo, ahora se por que estaban tan tan baratas. Estoy muy decepcionado de este producto. Ni siquiera pude regresarla pues ya hab&iacute;an pasado casi 4 semanas.
This is regarding the BRC-120 Sold by seller "dealcharged"Although the picture shows a genuine Boss BRC-120, you will receive a cheap Chinese compatible with a cord that is far too short to be practical. Certainly shorter than the BRC-120. It will be sealed in a Ziplock sandwich bag.I immediately initiated a return for this one and bought the $15 one from Amazon seller "Super Power Supply", as there appears to be no genuine unit available on Amazon at this time.So, I had both units at the same time and can confirm that they are EXACTLY the same Chinese units. Model SS-LWA140080BADon't waste your money on this listing.
Got the order in time.. Power supply isn't the one as listed.. It's some generic china no named brand, I needed one for my boss gt-8 that I had for a few years, the output type is the right one but the plug that goes to the unit is a little tight, I was hoping I was the right one, but I'm kinda bummed out on this... It works although, but the cords are really short..
Worked for 15 minutes then died. I wanted it for Holloween but never worked again. I went to Walmart and bought 3 battery operated strobes for $5 each. Working on getting my money back.
Shortly after we used the charger there was a loud "Pop" and the charger was smoking.I checked the primary circuit and there seems to be a short circuit.
Get an Ibanez Weeping Demon if you want a real wah pedal. The Weeping Demon doesn't have the confusing and frustrating on/off procedures that the crybaby does. Type it in the search box and check it out.
This capo coming in the mail really bright also its not tight enough. it leaves you with a buzzing sound on your guitar. plus it seems to damage guitars after awhile of  uses.
otherwise, its nice model and if/when i play a six string or skinny neck guitar, it will be useful...  probably gift it to a friend before then
After hearing a lot of good things about the Dunlop Straplok System, my fiance' was very dissapointed once he installed them on his Antique White PRS Starla.  He has since switched them on all of his guitars to the Schaller Strap Locks except at his Fender Stratocasters where on them he is strictly using the Fender Straplock w/Button system.  It appears that he is sticking with what works.
These strap locks work fine once in place but when your strap is unlocked from your instrument, the side attached to your strap falls apart.  There is nothing holding the lock to your strap when not attached to your instrument which may be fine lf you never detach but otherwise, plan on losing the tiny washers every time you take your strap off.  Total waste of money.
Just got these in the mail. Didn't see on the product description that I would possibly have to drill into my bass in order to install them.
Thought I would upgrade and get Martins.  I have a half a dozen ukes of varying sizes and styles.  Purchased 2 sets.Total crap.  Buzzing, breaking.  The two sets lasted a total of 17 days.  Total waste of money.Went down to the local store and got some cheap plastic crap.  Have had those on the big banjolele now for 3 months with no trouble at all.  Will stick to those.
I never received this gadget.I often wonder whether I would have liked it or not.Some kind of mix-up, I suppose.
This pop filter works for the element for what it's made for, but if you dont have a position to put it without bending it much, then it's not worth your time. It's a total piece of s*** when it comes for placing it! Very disappointed..
Returned this item due to the flexible neck part being to flexible. Would not stay in the position I set it at all.
Just as others have stated, the gooseneck on this filter is useless because it cannot hold up the weight of the filter.  I've overcome this problem a bit by attaching some straps to the mic stand and around the filter head but that's not an acceptable solution.  If I could do it again, I wouldn't purchase this filter.
I bought this with my blue snowball because EVERYONE said you needed it for sound quality. Don't bother you don't sound weird saying A's Or S's if you speak normally. It shows dust really badly as well.
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).
huge untir. heavy, bulky and wont stay where it is clamped. frustrated. sits in closet. dont waste your money and all!!
Looking at the product, it seems "ok". But the thing is, at $16+ and made in China?? That's way too much! Normally, I can let this issue slide and still give it a 5 Star since price is really up to the buyer and not the seller. THE REASON WHY 1 START IS BECAUSE IT CAME TO ME BROKEN! THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE GOOSE NECK AND THE CLAMP IS LOOSE!IT'S SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE JUST TO RETURN AN ITEM TO SELLER, PAY FOR MAILING IT AND WAIT FOR A VERY LONG TIME TILL YOU GET IT BACK! These companies should know that and should do strict quality control on their items. It's just a Microphone Pop Filter! MAKE IT RIGHT PEOPLE!!!! DON'T INCONVENIENCE YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!TO THE POSSIBLE BUYERS:CONSIDER WHAT I WROTE HERE. THE PRODUCT IS MADE IN CHINA AND I FIND IT TOO PRICEY FOR HOW IT WAS MADE. THE GOOSE NECK CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CLAMP AND POP FILTER DOES NOT LOOK STRONG ENOUGH! RETURNING IT AND WAITING FOR A LONG TIME IS JUST NOT WORTH IT!
I expected more for less but got less for more. It does what it's suppose to, but not nessary to have.
The mouthpiece is too open, you will not get a prefessional sound on this mouthpiece, which is bad considering the price. This mouthpiece worsened my tone
I've been playing Blues harp in various bands, for about 30 years now, and I've got a bunch of different types of microphones. This is at the bottom of the pile, let me tell you! It's way TOO big and HEAVY to play for any length of time and make the cupping moves that give your playing its tonal range and texture. The earlier magnetic resonance 520D (without volume knob) mics like James Cotton used to play, were interesting for their sound quality, but the Astatic JT30 and some other Shure mics, out-perform this clunky "brick" by far.....I tried to sell my Green Bullet, but couldn't even get $50 for it on a popular auction site. Now, I wouldn't give you $10 for this "collector's" gem, it doesn't work for performers, but looks authentic enough ha ha! The joke is on whomever thinks this is a cool mic.
I have purchased and installed 3 of these units.  Two in church sound systems and one in my home.  All of the units have had problems reading certain CDs.  I get "no disk" errors or it takes a very long time to read the CD, both of which are unacceptable in a unit of this price. These CDs have been "brand new out of the box" and CDRs I've recorded.  Sometimes they read sometimes they don't.  I can not recommend this unit.
I just got the SR-16. I unpacked it and turned it on. It worked for a couple of hours and then it simply stopped working. Now, I have to box it up and send it back. This is very uncool. The QA on this product did not work!Crap!!!!!!!!
I bought this as a gift for my husband - it was on his Amazon wish list.  However, upon checking, he said that it's part of a kit and they no longer make the other components, so it's basicly useless.  There was also no invoice included with the product when it arrived.  I've been trying to return the item to the manufacturer but they refuse to reply to my inquiries, so I'm likely out the $160 and am extremely disappointed.
I bought this for myself to surprise my fiance' who has a blue grass band.  I was hoping to learn how to play so we could jam together.  I bought it in June and havent had time to even pick it up.  Well, its a rainy weekend.  Figured we would get it out, and it doesnt work.  We plugged it into two different amps and nothing!  Thanks a bunch : (
Doesn't register hardly anything, it feels cheaply made, and I literally threw it away upon realizing that it didn't work worth a damn. Do not buy.
It will turn off randomly (sometimes before a minute is up). I assume it's because of the batteries not being able to fit properly into the device. This makes the device basically unusable if it won't stay on long enough for you to tune anything properly.
I bought an Ephiphone Les Paul Tribute Plus and this case was included with the guitar. It will protect your guitar around the house and going to practice. The quality is exceptionally poor. The cover is soft and tears really easy even with a gentle bump. The trim that covers the seam on the outside fabric was loose on mine and soon to fall off. Epiphone sent me a replacement case and it was just as bad as the first. I bought a Gator abs case and while it is not a flight case, is much more durable than this case.It was "free" with the Tribute, but it just makes me question the quality standards of Epiphone - although the Tribute Plus could not be a nicer, better made guitar.
The entire back area was broken away from the sides&#8230; I have a couple of these case already and they are great, but this was broken when it was sent to me. Very disappointed in the shipper.
This is a piece of crap that will not stay in tune, its tinny in the lower frets, Gibson says they don't cover set ups. MUSICIANS Friend will not let me return it. So listen up when buying a guitar online set ups are never covered Its not a good plan to buy one online. Now I may have to pay up to 100 bucks to get this set up. So just remember that.
The strings broke during tuning. Also, the sound quality does not seem to be the best. Kind of disappointed by the product
When I first got it i loved it... been two months now i hate it.Frets keep popping out and i have to put them back in...  I have had to put three frets back in.. they keep popping out as of right now it has two more dead spots because the frets are not pushed down enough and wont stay down. I honestly hate this guitar.
Will never buy a guitar from this dealer again. Sent me the wrong guitar and then wanted me to wait 45 days for another one. This was for my husbands Valentines gift and now I didn't have anything to give to him. The people were not reasonable at all. very rude.
This was a good guitar while it lasted, but after about 9 months the bridge tailpiece assembly is coming unglued and pulling away from the body. Can't say I'm surprised given what I paid.
I purchased this product on August 3..When I recieved it my bulbs where broke...I ordered this product earlier enough 2 recieve it 4 a party that i am having on August 29,but yet to recieve the replacement bulbs.....
I ordered this and I got skb13... which is for ovation...I ordered this because I have to take this on a flight.i dont have a hard case, but it was not a prblem becasue i had a business class until nowbut i am in a econmy class this time and they dont let you carry musical instruments unless you are in business class or higher i am leaving in 2 days and I would have find someone who would let me borrow it... thanks for sending the wrong one

i ordered this case as a replacement for my big plastic one and the day after i started using it  my trumpet was bent from the brace forward so the bottom line is THIS CASE SUCKS!!!!!!!! IT IS HORRIBLY PADDED
Still getting issues with neighbors after installing this foam around my entertainment center area to hold back bass transfer.Not working as expected.
This is a beautiful guitar bag.  I loved it... until I went to put my bass in it.  I have a b.c. rich bronze series warlock bass guitar.. and about an inch or a little more doesn't fit in the case... so if you're looking for an affordable cool looking case for your warlock bass, look past this one.
The envelope for the string arrived promptly - it was a bit tattered and stained, but it did arrive on time and looked just like the picture of the envelope that is supposed to contain the string. Unfortunately, the envelope was empty. I did not receive the string and it's very frustrating. I wish I could review the string as well as the envelope. I'm very disappointed by the sloppy packaging by Amazon on this one.
I bought a new product as a gift... I sent it without openning the seller box, two months latter I asked if he liked my gift and he say.. Thanks its great, it has a really few use.. I like!What's up? I bought a New Drumsticks and, the seller sent me a used pair
Based on the good reviews, I thought these strings would be a good quality for the price.  Unfortunately, three of the strings broke before I could even tighten them to the correct pitch.  I could understand this happening to one of the strings as a fluke, but not three.  I will never buy these strings again.
I purchased a box of 10 alto sax reeds, but only received 9 in the box.  After waiting a month to hear from Vandoren "customer service" (if that's what they call it), and then wasting a lot of time going back-and-forth about my claim that the box was short a single reed, they finally agreed to ship a single reed to me (though they seemed quite reluctant to do so, as though I have nothing better to do than scam them for a $2.00 reed).  Well, another month later, I have yet to receive the reed they shorted me on my initial purchase.  They don't seem a bit fazed that they are the ones who have ripped me off, not the other way around.
I could barely get any phrase out and I normally have no trouble.I had repairman check horn and it is in good shape but the new reeds SR222 dont work for me

This really is a nice guitar--great tone, clear crisp sound, and very high quality construction.  Unfortunately, I'm 0-2 with the pre-amp.  With the first guitar I received the pre-amp Level was inoperable and the E and B strings weren't being picked up at all.  Amazon sent me a new one straight away (great return policy--thanks Amazon!).  Unfortunately (again), the new one I received today didn't fair much better and I have it packed up for return and a full refund.  The pre-amp is completely dead--and yes I tried a couple new batteries.  I REALLY like the sound of this guitar, but I bought it to go electric.  I'm going to go back to researching alternatives in the price range.  I've owned Fender, Yamaha, and Takamine acoustics and thought I'd go with Alvarez because of the reviews I've read.  I'm not giving them a third strike.  Packing up guitars and driving across town to the UPS center was never part of the bargain.  To those of you who had better luck and love this guitar, good for you and play on!
I was super stoked with it until one day it just stopped working entirely. Since I opened the package, I put it in it's cradle on the stand and didn't touch it; and then one day it just cut out entirely. Too late to return it, can't get any technical help that doesn't cost me more money.
I'm gonna have to give this a One-star, because the 1st (E) string broke when I put it on and was tuning up the guitar. I have played the guitar for 10 years and hence can say that I was tuning the guitar to the right pitch. The string broke at "bead-end", close to the bead. I'm probably not buying these strings again.
I just bought these, strung my guitar with them, went to tune it, the fourth string snapped the first time I turned the peg, the inner and out parts of the string separated, it was unusable. Never again.
Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string.
I first want to say I agree with the good reviews for these picks. Quality wise, they are very good. The grip on them is superb and the sound is great. HOWEVER, I chose these picks rather than the cheaper ones because of the image Amazon has for them. I was expecting the 6 different colors, and all I was shipped was the blue.Though the quality is nice, spend less money on the other generic Dunlop Tortex picks because the only reason to spend more on these is the thought you'll get a variety of color choices. Wrong! Beware the misleading picture!
Ink comes off with just a couple minutes of use.  When I first saw a used pick I seriously thought it was an old pick I may have had, and tossed it in the trash since I had new ones to try out.When I saw the second pick after some use, and saw the ink all over my fingers .. and could only think of everything I had transferred ink onto including my guitar, the rest went in the trash.I have the stiffer yellow ones and none of them have any ink left, but it comes off much slower so I never noticed an issue.  But probably won't buy any picks with ink on them in the future.Perhaps the ink can be removed with alcohol or mineral spirits?
Dunlop .73 picks are the best picks in the world as far as I'm concerned. At a music store they range from 25 to 40 cents each. The description for this item does not show a quantity. Now that I received it, I find you get a dozen for less than four bucks, which wouldn't be bad, but then with the cost of shipping I ended up paying close to nine bucks for twelve picks. I did not see anywhere in the description of the item where they told how many picks you get, and I was hoping for more.
they are very cheap ang flimzy.they wear down very easy.i know they are not exspencive.i hate them
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase.
this is not a microphone stand. it is a rubber piece you see in the picture that holds guitar picks NOT A STAND. its not even 7 feet or 7 inches it is more like 3-4 inches
I bought several of these for my guitars.  What a mistake.  The sponges are tiny and all of them dried out within a day.  Not very convenient.  I am going back to using household sponges in sealed plastic bags with holes punched in!  Planet Waves does not have a great reputation for quality humidifier systems.
This goes between your 3 and 4 strings, spreading them both way out. This constant stretch will ruin your strings quicker as well as widening your guitar's nut. This is a really awful design. I mean, really awful.
bought one, then found out how small the sponge is. IMO it's not worth buying unless you need minimal addition of humidity
This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too...
This stuff will kill your strings very quickly. I personally don't prefer dead strings but I know some people do. Just not my thing.
I was really excited to get such a nice looking guitar strap. However, I ordered the tan strap and received a strap that was much much darker in color. It was a russet/orange color. I was very disappointed. They should change the picture color as it does not reflect the actual product whatsoever. If you are planning on getting the Tan strap, be warned, it is orange and not like the image at all. Very very disappointed and unhappy with this.
Professional drummer who uses a lot of Evans heads.  This head should not be used for a bass drum.  Even by determining the lowest possible tone, it's still going to sound like a mid tom.  We spent hours trying to get a good sound out of it, and was unable to do so.  For a head with a deep, booming sound for about the same price, try the Evans EMAD with the interchangable damper rings. You'll be much happier.
kept unsticking from my drum kickit didn't have much adhesive
Worked well for a month. I used it everyday. Eventually the hole where the bearing sits wore out and the strap won't hold my guitars weight for a solid 10 minutes. First time this happened, the guitar slammed into a wall. Not too happy about that. Last time i'll buy a cheap strap.
This strap was great until I used it for a gig and it slipped off my guitar, which subsequently crashed to the ground and chipped in several places... The material where it attaches to the guitar is too flimsy to hold anything heavier than a couple of pounds, so I wouldn't recommend it for anything you might care about..
If you go to a drum shop and pick these out for yourself it is possible to get very good ones.  By mail order the ones that I got were not solid wood and very flimsy-not much good for anything.
I purchased this item on 9/30/10. It is now 11/5/10 and I still have not recieved it. I have already made two requests to cancel the purchase, but they refused to do so by responding with a fake ups codes. I am very disappointed in their service and responsibility to their customers.
Do not buy!  I bought these twice and had them replaced twice.  Never again.  The Evans Dot drum head is much better.
Due to a misplaced screw too close to the zipper track, the clarinet bag could not be unzipped and therefore was returned.  This particular item should never have left the factory.
I bought this expecting a ten pack of tips - I got one tip.
Hmm... I play pedal steel, and I usually use an Echoplex to get some slap back and a few other tricks. I have a show coming up, where I am going to have to fly cross-country. So, I figured I get a Reel Echo, and leave the old `plex at home. When I first saw the unit, I was impressed that they designed it to resemble the sliding tape head instead of a knob for the length of the delay. Needless to say, it's just not the same. Doesn't have the right feel at all. And you can't get that great feedback loop either. Now I will admit, for the sound on sound function, it's perfect. But I've never needed to use that on my Echoplex. I will say that it is a good delay pedal, but if you want the sound of a real tape delay, the Reel Echo is not it.
doesn't sound like a spring reverb at all IMHO.  no huge surprise there, but it really sucks.I didn't expect much, but it was still an awful let-down.
I waited with baited breath for this to arrive based on Fishmans description.  I thought well, this will be great to be able to adjust the mic portion of the pick-up.  Silly me!!! The flexible shaft of the mic just LIMPLY sags and will not stay where you position it.  You would think Fishman (making such good pick-ups) would have made a more sturdy flexible shaft.Got it today----going back today.
It never worked.  Very disappointing for our kids.  It just smelled like it was burning when we added liquid and turned it on.
Fuse blew without me using twiceBad item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But you might be able to get a bother fuse but that sucks
WORSE PURCHASE EVER.  IT JUST DIDN'T WORK RIGHT. LITTLE PUFFS OF FOG, BORING.  I WONT PURCHASE ANYMORE PRODUCTS FROM CHAUVET.
Received two of these that refused to power up at all. Reseated the brand new batteries multiple times, tried different chords, etc. Buyer beware&#8230;
I bought the Pignose lil PA for my church group and it had a similar problem to other posts, sound died out after a minute or 2. I am an electrical engineer and checked into the amplifier circuit. I discovered that the design is flawed leading to the bad performance. I fixed mine and it now plays great. The flaw is such that the internal circuit can actually self distruct. If yours still has some sound at initial switch on, then fails after a few minutes, it likely can be saved. Refer to a qualified electrical engineer for repair, or contact me on facebook tom gehman needham.
It just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. I hate it.
I can't get it to work cuz my computer does not recognize the drivers. I wish I hadn't bought it.
I bought one of these and was initially quite happy.Unfortunately within 2 months it had completely fallen apart.I've never taken the time to write a product review, but I'm so dissatisfied that I had to.Other reviews here are good, so maybe I just got a lemon.
i bought this for its features and compartnemts, the dividers seems ok and the small cymbals compartment on the outside. what realy sold me on this is it has a compartment for felts etc.. and the back pack part was a good idea.down side: you cannot use it as a back pack the material will rip. i slowly tried it with a 22 ride 18crash 16crash 14 hi-hats 10 splash all sabian aax. and i think its about atleast 15 to 20 pounds.i slowly lift it to try it and there it is it hasent even lift off the ground and i heard it rip. its still in perfect shape i just cant use it as a back pack. its just a bonus for me anyways..FOLLOW UP REVIEW 1st night of this bag with me the zipper broke!! stir away from this.. i think all retailers should return this product to zildjian. its junk!
The Polish is great but there is no excuse for their packaging. Gummy sticky glue on the cloth holding the bottle face side out in package.
They left the burrs on the threads of the screw and I have spent the whole day wire brushing and forcing it to screw in to the bezel. Only got it 3/4 of the way (with channel locks) and it wont go any further. One worked fine, screwed in like butta. Bezels look gold, they're chrome ignore the photo. How come I'm wishing I hadn't paid 50$ and just bought a Japanese built stop tail instead.
Amazon shows 2 cases in the image.  You only get one folks!  I guess someone marketed it that way to get a sale from a non-attentive shopper such as myself.  This review is solely on the deceptive advertising however to be fair I do think Amazon is the best on the net.  Moral - pay attention to scams like this.
thanks to your poor imagination, I had to pay $160 more to the courrier, A bag that suppouse cost $34 USD, ended at $194, This is not acceptable. BE CAREFUL
These are not the Signature Ringo Starr sticks shown in the Picture.  These are plain, unfinished Hickory 5AL.  Do not order these drum sticks if you want the ProMark autographed series.  Not the same look or feel.Unhappy Customer!
I bought the gallon size because you're "supposed" to use the same brand of juice as the machine.  Well half the time it just spit juice out on the floor, and made some bubbles, but not many.  I thought it was the wands and was going to have to replace them.  I was doing a wedding last weekend and used the tekno bubbles that I've had, figured why not.  Dang did it put out bubbles like never before.  So from now on I won't buy American DJ juice.  I'm going to try a different brand, but if I have to keep buying the tekno brand, so be it.  They look cool with the lights on them anyways, as the juice is made for blacklights.
What a mistake! I bought the bubble machine and these recommended bubbles. The machine was overflowing and stopped up with the fluid within 5 minutes of plugging it in. Both the bubble machine AND the bubbles... terrible waste of money!
When I received the Tri Gem Led Moonflower, the invoice also stated that it was in the package and it wasn't! Let you guys some messages about it, and have yet to get a response from you all!!  What the Heck???
I got the tripod fast but,  the packaging was horrible! Some parts are broken and can't use the tripod. I think it would have worked fine but the packaging was crap. I still haven't gotten in touch with anyone about it. I want it replaced! Basically the part that's broken is where I can't extend it up to the 12 feet. So it won't go up cause the knob is broken off and I can't extend! Bummer!
This item was poorly packaged.  The box looked like it was taken from a dumpster and taped to contain the tripod. Holes all over the box! Broken piece and  a missing piece to hold the &#34;T&#34; bar.  I am unfortunate to receive such a rubbish item.  I hope that the seller will see and read this review.  To think that this product is one of expensive tripods out there. I am very disappointed. Fish vendors are better in wrapping the fish they sell.
Do not buy this item.  I recieved it and one of the knobs were broken into 4 pices.  i found something to make it work just to see how it would work.  Very unstable, cheap material, and overall just a product i would not waste my money on.  This item was sent back.
Make sure you have the right size. I didn't know they came in different size. Now im stuck with them.
The info on Amazon says says 25W.  Not on the box.  The strobe light says 14W and so does the label on the box.  Thought the light looked dim.  Now I know why.  The model number on the label on the generic looking box says model S-81.
I purchased the VcoPro Bravo.  It was very disappointing. The device did not perform as advertised. First of all, it does not play cds. It stateds cd/cd +g.  if you sing too loud is pauses.  It also stops reading the cd in mid performance. I am sending it back the very next bussiness day.  I have a karaoke device that I paid way less for and it works great.  I do not recomend this device.  it's too expensive and it does not come with a remote or microphones.
The one thing that has not been mentioned in any of these reviews is the license for this product. This software cannot be used for commercial use without permission from one of their "duly authorized representatives".  I'm not sure, but I bet this is a costly proposition. So if you want this product for an amusing game, it's fine. If you want to use it for music that you plan to sell, even if you are including your own playing on it, avoid it.If you think that making loops of your own playing will let you off the hook, no, it won't. The license includes anything made with the software, so even if you want to sell your own music, PLAYED BY YOU, you have to talk to one of their representatives. If they give you permission to sell your OWN work, you still have to put their logo on it, which says, "Magix Creation". How nice......
I bought this several years ago, I just tried to load into on my computer with windows and they do not make drivers for this model any longer. I dont know why they are even selling this on Amazon.
I really like this piece of equipment and I have used it for years. The one star is for their customer contempt.When trying to install the Mac OSX driver on my new machine it came up saying that is was broken.To make a long story short I have been waiting for 8 days for a response, received no help, not been able to talk to a live person, got blocked emails in the automated responses from their office with no chance to answer. After finding a phone number they had an answering machine there. They did take their time to put my email on their sales email and I already received the first product offers.This is the kind of stuff that ruin companies brands and cuts off customer loyalty, two things today that you need to make an extra effort to look after.
We had enjoyed playing one our grand dad made and were surprised by how easy it was to learn. This model is useless. The neck is too short to get any recognizable strums /notes out. Might as well have bought a $15 non-playable kids' store model. Wish we had put this $70 towards one that you can actually play a song on. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY.
Too small and light. Improper intonation. Returned item.
I picked one of these up in my search for an affordable compressor.  The compressor action itself was quite nice, but the pedal also would sometimes pick up radio stations when engaged.  That's totally unacceptable!  Stay away.
My daughter says this hurts her neck. There is absolutely no padding. Also it seems that the velcro doesn't work well.
I purchased these strings and put them on my Alvarez, Even after 3 weeks they were still constantly going out of tune. I couldn't even play three songs without having to retune. I'm going back to my Martin 80/20's.
I purchased these strings to replace my old ones which were turning my fingers black, each time I played. While they work well,  and are easy on the fingers, they sound really tinny. One of the lower strings has also started to leave a black residue on my finger, even though I wipe down my guitar each time I practice. So, yes these strings serve their purpose, but i would think twice about buying these again.What do you know, two weeks later, the high e string breaks, and leaves me with a lovely welt across my fingers. Not buying again.
As I began to tune these babies up the first string broke once it had a tiny bit of tension in it. No spares so now I have to order another set. I know this happens once in a while. Too bad.. sticking to Elixirs.
I've owned a few pioneer headphones over the years cause I like the sound, but they always break. The swivel above the earpieces are plastic and this always crack. ALWAYS. I bought a pair years ago and through warranty replacements I've actually ended up with 8 new ones over the years for the price of one pair. I thought they finally fixed the problem by upgrading me to the new metal swivel design but guess what? The plastic piece above the metal swivel broke.I'm now awaiting my free new replacement in the mail from pioneer..in the meantime ill break in the Allen and Heath headphones.I've been a dj for years and if wasn't for all the free headphones pioneer keeps sending me as a replacement i'd never own a pair anymore.  They should just stick to making turntables and mixers.
Please be advised that in the case of the Fender 7250HM bass strings pictured in the Fender Box with the big F in a big Red circle with Made in USA (lower right corner) is just that, a picture, or as it was called in the old days, bait and switch or false advertising and this was the order from Amazon's warehouse! I'm waiting to see which strings are coming from a different seller on Amazon that I ordered from at the same time. I did send that seller an e-mail informing them if strings are not what was advertised, to cancel order. To be fair to Amazon I had a credit that I applied to the purchase, which I appreciate, and on every page up to an including confirming the order was that big old F in a red circle with Made in USA box. I received two Fender 7250HM bass strings packages in plastic sleeves with the picture of a Jazz bass, blue background and assembled in Mexico. Not what I ordered or expected. I've used these strings before for practice sessions, but use the USA's for recording (yes there is a difference in sound). I had to cancel a previous order for strings from a Amazon seller, because they could not fill the order, although it laid out as if they could. I give Amazon the BIG F AWARD for there stellar non performance, but gave them one star for on time delivery!
The presentation is not good. The guy is not prepared, repeats himself, lacking of methodology... Beside he got some horrible nail infection so the maestro's hands looking like he just had outbreak of leprosy. It is difficult to watch and hard to concentrate on video.
I bought this one and Flamenco guitar method volume 1 by gerhard graf martinez. The guitar method by martinez is incomparably better than this one because here Aaron just plays flamenco with basic explanation on the chords, but flamenco is not about chords it's about right hand moves. I didn't have the patience to view long enough into dvd but I couldn't find where he explains how to play rasgaedo. And honestly what the heck did he do with his left nails. They look absolutely horrible. I understand it's easier to play this way, but c'mon! life ain't about self torture...The flamenco guitar method by martinez starts right away from the technique of the rasgaedo, right away you start playing tango.May be when I'm much more advanced I can appreciate more this dvd, for now it's useless.
Cello strings are quite expensive, so I thought I was getting a deal getting this one on amazon for only ten dollars. However, I was incredibly disappointed when I finally recieved it. First of all, it wasn't in it's original packaging as shown. Secondly, it was used. Last of all, IT WASN'T EVEN A CELLO STRING. It was a USED guitar string! I was beyond upest. Rest assured I will never buy from THIS user ever again. What a jerk.
This was a rip off!!!! because they send me rusty strings and they burst when putting them on the violin so I give this product a all thumbs down
This thing feels cheap and fragile.  The knobs come right off, they're not rugged at all and I wouldn't trust them for gigging.  AND mine broke after five minutes of use; it worked fine (and sounded good) at first, but then developed a loud, obnoxious electrical crackling noise.  Probably a bad solder connection somewhere.  Maybe this pedal used to be made in Japan (quality) and is now made in China (cheap) or some situation like that.  Try before you buy.
Soft pot-metal with lumpy gold paint, thick uneven rails, a ligature that fell apart the first time I touched it. It looks nothing like my other 2 Otto Link pieces for Tenor and Alto.***** They really need to post a photo of the other side with the cap off! ******Because of punitive return rules, I exchanged the 6* for the back-ordered 7* because it would have to have at least a bigger throat. It did, but still not enough and not really free-blowing like any of the older pieces. The finishing and plating was also better, at least it is playable. Still, I going to keep looking for an older Otto Link Soprano mouthpiece. Feel free to contact me if you have one!
They are not Gut.  they are nylon treble and wound steel bass strings.  They're good strings, but mis-labeled in Amazon.
It took literally five days for the dealer to even begin to ship this 'in stock' item.  I am imagining that the shelf this product was on was buried in a basement somewhere, and nobody at the store wanted to make the effort to go and get it.  Who knows when I will receive it, since it has been two weeks and I finally see the product making it to USPS in tracking on Amazon.  In USPS' capable hands, I'm sure to get this with a few bruises by Thanksgiving, I suppose. :(.  It's a good thing that I didn't pay extra for expedited shipping.  Note to self: only buy things that have the Amazon Prime logo, since these always ship quickly and in great condition.
So I understand that I should have read further....but honestly, the picture is of a set of bongs -  A SET OF BONGOS - would it be too much to ask for a clearer picture of what will be sent?  Even a small view of just the head itself?  My SNAFU but clearly, from other reviewers, I am not the first to make this mistake.
got what I didn't order but was my fault for not reading,I go by pics , my reading is below hell, so I kinda rely on the pictures
The winder apparatus began to squeak terribly after only a couple re-strings.  It eventually fell off and will no longer stay attached.
The string winder isn't made well enough to prevent it from slipping off the keys when winding.  Have to push real hard on the base of the mechanism to prevent it from falling off the keys of the  guitar.
It gets the job done, but I think the plastic makes it squeak so much you can't pay attention to anything else. I wish I had known before I purchased. I even tried greasing it up but any pressure on it makes it squeak.
Cheap and nasty I'd say.The worst part is that the actual winding part is held with a single screw, right where you turn. So you turn the screw along with it and the whole thing falls apart, and before that it runs uneven, putting stress on your tuner assembly. After some use I find I need to re-tighten the screw every single string worth of use.The thing holding the tuner is also a bit thin, it's a tight fit for some tuners.
Worked okay - nothing special - for about 30 days. Then the cutter end broke in half leaving a sharp edge and an unusable tool. I would second the view already posted here: get a cheaper one and buy a pair of wire cutters. Both will last much longer and work just as well or better.
This winder will tighten strings no problem! The cutter seems to do its job as well.However, when you go to unwind or loosen strings the part that goes over the knobs comes loose then it comes off.If you look at the design there is one screw holding that piece and the handle together.Every time I try to loosen a string the screw loosens too and the winder always ends up in two pieces.No matter how hard you tighten that screw it always seems to come out leaving this product useless.
There were no cotton polishing cloths in the package. I was supposed to have two of them but there were none.
Had to buy another strap. Would not recommend to anyone who plays above their belt. There is not much room for adjustment.I am 6 ft 190 and like to play chest high. I tied a knot in the strap to get it high enough. Better off getting a 10$ cheepo and a tuner.
I found this to be irritating to my neck because of its width - the edges dug into my neck. Also, the foam rubber on my skin caused me to sweat. I gave it a shot but had to return it.
At a friend's suggestion, I purchased a set of these hoping to reduce the number of times I had to replace my strings. The 3rd string (D-string) snapped during installation and the string wasn't even close to being up to tension.While it would be theoretically great to have a set of strings that would last much longer, paying 3-4 times the going rate for a set of strings that breaks during installation is ridiculous. I contacted Elixir, but never heard a word. So much for their quality control and customer service. Not impressed!I would suggest sticking with more reliable strings (Martin, ghs, etc.).
Hardly lasted on my grandsons guitar one day.  Don't buy these things, they are truly junk .  Find something else
I put these strings on my Gretch solid body, 70's vintage.  I love the full and varied sound I can get with this guitar, can play anything with it.  I don't play as much as I used to so I thought I would try the nanoweb coating on some super lights.  Hated the sound.  Not very full, and this guitar has very rich sound.  Almost tinny.I have never had a set of strings that were worse than these in over 40 years of playing.
If anyone is thinking about buying these, DON'T. Do not waste your money on these strings. If you like to precisely control what you're playing (especially if you play Metal), do not get these strings. The coating is too slippery and feel uncomfortable. And most importantly!! The tone is NOT bright and the sustain is horrible. They can't hold a chord without fading quickly especially if you bend a lot. If you want amazing, well manufactured, loud and controllable strings I suggest checking out GHS Boomers. With GHS you will not be disappointed, unlike Elixir. ( I personally use GHS Boomers TnT [thin top heavy bottom])
Elixir sucks! I don't know how they got their reputation. they buzz. they break. they do not last. they are house brand guitar strings at best. their fancy packaging and hyped up reviews (that they probably pay people for) are not worth it. buy anything else.
I could tell right away the cable I received was not a genuine Mogami. First, it did not come in Mogami packaging. Second, it did not have the protectors on the ends with the Mogami name in gold.After some investigation I learned that these cables are constructed by some guy in Michigan who buys bulk Mogami parts and constructs them himself.This by itself is not bad. That was the only way Mogami cables were available for many years. The problem is he represents them as the genuine article when, in fact, they are counterfeits.I contacted Mogami and they said, "Premium Audio Cables is not selling cables made by us. He is making them using Mogami and using our trademark without permission."I also contacted Amazon, but as of this writing, they are still selling these phony cables. I thought you should be warned.
I've used these several years ago off & on for live performance & recordings on a few different guitars & the experience was the same. Yes they are bright, the density 1.78 of Fluorocarbon [polyvinylidene difluoride, PVDF] is much higher than basic Nylon 1.3 & a little higher than Catgut. They also increase the treble string tension: 17.44 lbs for the high E. Extra Hard Tension Pro Arte Nylon from D'Addario for example is 17.41 lbs for the high E. The volume people notice in Fluorocarbon is simply because of the higher tension trebles. These are really Extra Hard tension strings & their other Higher tension strings are beyond practicality & do not resonate properly. I recommend those who like these tensions to try the new D'Addario EJ44 Extra Hard Tensions strings, they're much more dynamic with higher quality bass strings.A Normal Tension Nylon set the high E is around 15.3+ lbs. So the Fluorocarbon trebles are really a Extra Hard Tension set [Savarez has called these a Medium Tension as well?] when compared to Nylon tension terminology, with 2 lbs more for the High E. Also the Alliance A string is .034" & lighter than an average Normal Tension set [A .035"], & the Alliance D string is .0295" & thicker with higher tension than an average Normal Tension Nylon Set [D .029].What I found with the Alliance set is that the bass strings don't last long at all & the silver comes off very quick. Also because the bass strings are "redesigned" to work with the higher tension trebles the notes on the low E past the 12th fret do not resonate/intonate well. The D string frays & basically falls apart. The Fluorocarbon trebles especially the high E frays & cracks.I appreciate Savarez brought in Fluorocarbon to the guitar string world from Kureha who makes fishing line & now supplies string companies. There are several grades & densities of Fluorocarbon, & since Savarez introduced Fluorocarbon Kureha improved the material greatly, but Savarez uses the older version. So what I did is experiment with Fluorocarbon fishing line: You can use Normal or High Tension basses from online or guitar center, & for high E string use 30 lb line [40 lb line if you wanna match the Alliance set], B string 60 lb line & for G string 80 lb line. This is the same as the Alliance trebles set but the high E is lighter & brighter & the basses Normal Tension allow for resonant notes past the 12 fret, which is important for cutaway classical guitars that use the whole fretboard.Buying spools of line can be cheaper in the long run. Guitarists need to understand that some string companies use nothing more than fishing line for their classical guitar strings. Clear Nylon is fishing line. Rectified Nylon [which dampens harmonics & kills tone] is ground nylon & smoothed out after the process for a "warmer tone" [??? People are using Fluorocarbon precisely because of rectification??? It ruins Nylon tone!]. Savarez rectified Nylon strings seem to only be ground & not polished [maybe trying to resemble Catgut texture or simply too cheap to finish it, yet charge high prices for their strings], their trebles screech & squeak horribly when moving your hand because of the texture & the notes lack higher order harmonics & overtones which treble strings are supposed to have regardless of instrument. Fishing line is perfectly round from the manufacturer through their own quality control process [& strings stretch cylindrical when tuned to pitch] & need nothing done to em & sound better.
I know a lot of saxophone players that plays this mouthpieces but is not for me. Im keeping my Aaron Drake...
I some how ordered the wrong size, I want 3.5 but got 2.5 somehow in the final order??? Shortly (MINUTES) I realized the problem I tried to stop the transaction. IT COULDN'T BE STOPPED - WHY??? I'm just going to get old school (in a store) from here on.
I bought the wrong ones for my child's alto sax and couldn't return them for credit. Totally upsetting. Too bad there wasn't a way to help folks when they accidentally make a mistake.
My cow does not like this cow bell. It's WAY TOO BIG. I don't know what kind of cow they were thinking of, but I've been around a lot of cattle, and I've never seen one that needs a bell that's this big.Also, I had to jury-rig a clapper (the part that rings the actual bell). This one came without one. I guess they want you to buy that separately (and probably pay separate shipping!)
Cornet mouthpieces don't fit in it. Doesn't work.
Using isntruction were not clear!When a I followed &#34; the box use instruction&#34; it were supposed towork as a peace of cake! but it didnt, turn little arm to the red dotted positionand then start aplying tension to your rods... well it didnt worked as I expected!
i did not like the sound, it is more like a noisy baby rattle, so you can not make too much really with them.
This product is cheap and thin. I was going to return but return costs $5.50! Bought another from GFS. Much better workmanship and grade metal.
When I got this, it was too big for the neck of my guitar. Because I didn't realize the size was wrong, the return cost is about as much as I paid for it in the first place and therefore it makes no sense to return it. Before you buy it, make sure it's the right size!
They show an image of and advertise this as a Dunlop 83CB but it is a cheap, no name, Chinese knock off. They say it's in stock and ships in 2-3 days but they fail to mention that it's coming from China and will be two to three weeks before you'll receive it. If you want the real thing don't buy it here. Most deceptive seller I've ever dealt with on Amazon.
The capo was not strong enough to hold down the guitar strings to obtain a clear tone. No matter how I adjusted it on the fret it would only give me half muted sounds. I returned it.
will not hold strings down effectively, not even sure if it is an actual Dunlop capo, no markings, also not really noted that it was coming from CHINA? so it yook a long time, Junk....
I already had one of these capos, so I knew I would like it. But that's not what I got.  The seller sent me a different model, which, unlike the Dunlop, you can't use one-handed.  I am a professional performer who needs to be able to deploy the capo on the fly, but the capo I was sent will not allow that.  So, if you want the Jim Dunlop 83BC capo, which is a great capo, order it from a different seller than I did.
I have been using this on a Cordoba 55fce and it just doesnt fit the neck properly. its too short and can BARELY cover all of the strings.
the sound is horrible and muted, does not resonate, do not buy.  its like playing with rubber finger picks, wtf?
I played 3 times with these sticks for a total of about 40 minutes and they broke. Very cheap don't waste your time.
I only got the 7A pair. It does say 7 AND 7A. I can't complain about the price, but give me what was advertised.
I play an electric bass and I need to turn down considerably to hear this metronome when practicing.  Further, it's takes longer to change tempos on this unit than on a dial unit -- this metronome jumps by 20 bpm when the adjuster buttons are held down, but that takes a second and if you're in between the 20's, you have to back track.  Finally, if I need to signal a tempo to my drummer before starting a song, there's no bright light showing the tempo -- and in a bar, he can't hear the clicks on this unit.Avoid this unit if these items are necessary for what you're doing.
Okay, so I can't comment on the sound or durability cause item came with its metal rim were bent.Usually, drum heads come inside a cardboard box but for some reason this item came inside a plastic bag.Wish there were another to swap it with.  Immediately returned it got prompt credit.
Although the CD used for setting up the  Yamaha Midi Interface is for Windows and Mac, my Mac could not read the CD.  I had to send it back.
When I opened the box all that remained of the shippment was the small open plastic box the picks were once in. Seems like Amazon is spreading picks all over the world since the picks obviously 'escaped' from the poorly sealed cardboard box. Seems rather strange to return an empty pick box but hey, its Amazon's dime...
I read the reviews, but figured, I was ordering with a few other things that would be shipped together, so the little plastic clamshell of picks would be well packed with a few other small items (capo, strings) and wouldn't be stuck in a huge box.  The picks were packed appropriately in a small box with my other items, but like so many other reviews it opened and the picks all came out. I was able to get 5 of them out of the box, the other seven disappeared.  Don't order these picks, you'll only get frustrated.  Wish I'd heeded the warnings I read here.
I received this purchase todsy and there were only 6 picks instead of the advertised 12.  This seems to be a recurring problem with this item.  I WOULD NOT SUGGEST ordering this item.  Very disapointing
What gives?My NINE picks came in the bottom of a box with TWO bulky boxes of heavier items. The picks' little soft, plastic container was wide open without ANY picks in it! The NINE picks were at the bottom of the box. I'm wondering WHY were they shipped in the same box as bulky items just in their little soft plastic case? The should have been in a cushioned envelope THEN placed in the box for shipment or mailed separately in a cushioned envelope. What was AMAZON thinking?To add insult to injury there were only nine picks in the bottom of the box. I'm not sure if Fender can't count OR the soft plastic case had sprung open prior to the AMAZON packing and never made the trip. Either way, the whole thing is DRECKY and the height of dreck-i-tude...shame on both Fender AND AMAZON!I'm so TICKED I haven't even pulled out my guitar to try the picks out. I'll include that after I calm down and speak to AMAZON Customer Service...
I was shocked to open this box, ordered from amazon, and see 3 empty containers! With a couple of loose picks in the box (I ordered 36). I thought the other feedback must have been a fluke but it's true. I requested a replacement but received an email from Amazon stating they would issue a refund instead of replacement because item was "out of stock", which it's not. So much for turning to amazon for gift buying :/Update: I had to re-order these & the key is order this item with other items that are big enough to limit movement of the pick package in the box = less pick loss.
I regret to inform those of the terrible service this company and or website offers. I made an order over a month ago...still no package. You have used up all my patience and in the future I will be taking my business elsewhere.
The packaging is a big problem here. The plastic shell the picks come in opens during transit and the picks scatter, as pointed out in other reviews. I got seven out of the dozen I ordered, which puts me in the upper-tier of success with this product and this vendor. But beare of the probabilities of not getting your money's worth...
Contrary to some reviews I think it's plenty loud, and I do like the wood-block sound. HOWEVER, what I failed to notice before purchase was that it skips numbers. In the slowest speed (largo) it allows you to chose times by 2.  For example, it goes from 42 to 44 then to 46, etc.  In Larghetto it goes up by three (from 60 to 63 then 66). From Andante it begins to increase tempo by 4 beats per minute (from 80 to 84 then 88). In Allegro and Presto the beats per minute go up by 6, from 120 to 126 to 132.  Thus, if you wanted to play a song at 128 bpm or 130 you would not be able to use this metronome. Might work for some players but not for me. Very bummed!I bought this to replace a digital metronome that I lost. I wish that I remembered the brand name of that one because it was very nice, and allowed me to set tempo to any speed I wanted, including odd tempos like 127 or 133.
i am sure the retailer did not mean to ship a defective Capo. They seem to be responsive in correcting the problem. I hope the $21 will be credited as per your e mail.
The capo has to be tightened very frequently during playtime- so it really does not make for practicing an ideal tool.The delivery time was spot on!
